1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,780
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,700
The youth, who had been ravaged by poison,

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,120
...was restored to life through my friend's efforts.

21
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,490
However, my friend said something to me.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,540
"I will not let his soul be lost yet.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,380
Not until the day that he himself snuffs out that light."

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,930
Act 10:
The Letter From Edmond

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,900
Monsieur Albert.

26
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,030
Have you managed to get any sleep?

27
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,890
If there is one thing I have confidence in, it's my stamina.

28
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,230
Well, you look like hell to me.

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,770
It looks like all the maids have been laid off.

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes, I heard.

31
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,210
I can't leave her alone in this house.

32
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,250
Besides, Franz told me something.

33
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,690
Marriage isn't necessarily the only way to make the person you love happy.

34
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,490
And so, I've been mulling it over as best I can.

35
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,720
What is the one thing that she needs most of all right now?

36
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,170
Maximilien...

37
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,770
She may be asleep now, but I think that Mademoiselle Valentine...

38
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,870
...is lonely to the point of crying.

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,840
So I at least want to be by her side when she wakes up.

40
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,190
Which is why I made up my mind today.

41
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,220
I'm going to take her to my family home in Marseilles to recuperate.

42
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,090
I don't want her to have to endure any more suffering.

43
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,100
I had a feeling that you would be here.

44
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,740
Your Honor, I came here today to discuss...

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,310
Mark my words, boy.

46
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,770
I dare you to try to take my daughter so much as one foot out of this house.

47
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,210
The instant you do, I'll have you arrested as a kidnapper.

48
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,110
That is no threat.

49
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,810
But the things that are happening in this house are...

50
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,390
Are none of your business!

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
Get out! You too, Albert.

52
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,950
Begging your pardon, sir,
but someone is trying to kill your family!

53
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,930
I myself was almost...

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,560
By "someone", you say?

55
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,630
If there is anyone close to hand who could be described as suspicious, it would be that impudent fraud of a Count!

56
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,870
Are we clear?! From now on, this is strictly a family matter!

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,140
I strictly forbid you from interfering!

58
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,820
The following is a report regarding my investigation on the Count of Monte Cristo.

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,260
In the course of visiting the various locations indicated by Your Honor,

60
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,620
...I discovered by accident that a certain old priest was making a similar set of inquiries.

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,200
He has visited this area several times during the past three months.

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,840
The priest seems to be gathering information on an old man who died penniless here.

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,580
The old man's name was Louis Dantes.

64
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,850
In order to ascertain the priest's objectives,

65
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,450
...as well as to clarify the connection between him and the Count of Monte Cristo,

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,200
...I plan to investigate the house that
Louis Dantes lived in while he was alive.

67
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,700
The old man's name was Louis Dantes.

68
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,100
Dantes...

69
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,830
Dantes?!

70
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,970
Papa, my school play is today.
You're coming, aren't you?

71
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,980
Didn't your mother tell you? I'm sorry, but some urgent business has come up.

72
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,810
But you promised! You said that you would come this time, no matter what!

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,290
Papa's work keeps him very busy, Edouard.

74
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,360
I don't care about that!
You're a liar, Papa!

75
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,660
Get him out of here. It's your job as his mother to explain these things to him!

76
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,070
But Edouard has been so excited about today.

77
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,010
I don't care how excited he was!
Stop bothering me!

78
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,980
Tell my teacher that the
yellow dwarf isn't gonna be in the play!

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,520
Monsieur.

80
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,500
What?

81
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,800
You're still here?
Hurry up and get your bags packed.

82
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,010
An invitation... An invitation to a funeral just arrived.

83
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,480
What's the meaning of this?

84
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,450
It's all well and good that I've inherited vast land holdings,

85
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,790
...but there's still so much that I don't understand.

86
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,560
The first thing is to learn the law inside and out.

87
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,100
That goes doubly so when you've come into possession of a huge inheritance.

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,770
If we don't keep estate taxes and whatnot under control, it can become a big problem.

89
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,540
Oh, I had no idea.

90
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,610
Truth be told, I'm looking for a partner who will be able to effectively manage my assets.

91
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,110
Oh, a partner, you say?

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,130
Mademoiselle Eugenie, would it be all right if
I paid you a visit in your room after I'm done?

93
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of my piano lessons.

94
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,500
Oh, for Heaven's sake...
Please forgive her lack of charm.

95
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,640
Not at all.

96
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,540
This is just between you and me,

97
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,480
...but there's a bit of a scandal beginning to brew around her fiancée's family.

98
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,480
Is something the matter?

99
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,330
N-No, it's nothing.

100
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,140
I have a letter here for the General.

101
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,720
Oh. Thanks.

102
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,980
Edmond Dantes?

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,420
Yes?

104
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm sorry, are you working?

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,130
No, that's all right.
I was just finishing up.

106
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,510
There's something that I want to talk to you about.

107
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,340
There is, eh?
Have a seat.

108
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,510
Now that the election is drawing near, there are a lot of matters that have to be taken care of.

109
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,450
I can imagine.
Oh, this was addressed to you.

110
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,220
A funeral invitation?

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,890
The thing is, I just got back from Villefort Manor.

112
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,770
I'd like to get Valentine away from that place.

113
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,210
I was wondering if there was anything that you could do to persuade her father.

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,250
She's in great danger every minute she stays there.

115
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,910
If the request came from you,
Monsieur Villefort might listen to...

116
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,150
Why do you feel the need to poke your nose into another family's affairs?

117
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,320
What do you mean, why?
My friend is...

118
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,330
Neither you nor your friend have any right to throw someone else's house into turmoil!

119
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,360
How can you say that?! You have no idea what's going on!

120
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,790
If we don't do something, she'll...

121
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,500
My answer is no!
Don't get involved any further!

122
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,530
What are you so angry about?!

123
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,780
My friend is in trouble, and you're telling me to just abandon her?!

124
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,370
Forget it. It was stupid of me to even ask.

125
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,030
What's the matter?
You look upset.

126
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,900
I got into a shouting match with Father, that's all.

127
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,300
I see.

128
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,240
Mother, do you know someone named Edmond Dantes?

129
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,220
Edmond Dantes?

130
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,980
Yeah. That was the name of the sender on a letter that came for Father today.

131
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,860
The instant Father saw that name, he started acting strangely for some reason.

132
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,800
What's the matter?

133
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,030
It's nothing. I haven't been sleeping well lately, that's all.

134
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,080
With the election race almost here,
I bet you're tired, too.

135
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,140
Yes, that might be it.

136
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,540
You should take it easy.

137
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,780
Who is he? Who's this
"Edmond Dantes" person?

138
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,800
That man is long since dead...

139
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,520
What could be worth coming all the way out here for?

140
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,010
Well, damn!

141
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,680
So, you were sent one of these, too.

142
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,390
Who's behind this?

143
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,390
I don't know.

144
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,220
It's just a stupid prank.
Let's get out of here.

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,190
But they knew us.

146
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,570
Someone knows about the connection between the three of us.

147
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,630
Well, well, the gang's all here...

148
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,810
Who the hell are you?

149
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,460
You're...

150
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,730
I'm your old friend Caderousse.

151
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,660
Now that you've made it big, have you forgotten about me along with all those unpleasant memories?

152
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,200
I see you're all big, powerful men now, not at all like you were in the old days!

153
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,970
You're the one who's behind this, Caderousse?
What kind of stupid stunt is this?!

154
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,110
I-I have one of these invitations, too...

155
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,220
Who could it be?

156
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,320
Someone else knows about us?

157
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,600
What's going on here?

158
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,940
You're asking me who else knows besides the four of us here?

159
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,710
Only this man.

160
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,650
Edmond Dantes?

161
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,650
But he was sent to the
Chateau d'If and...

162
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,150
Yes, I thought he died there.

163
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,420
The dead man has come back to us!

164
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,190
Edmond would never forget what we did to him.

165
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,100
He would never forget what we did, not in a million years.

166
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,540
Whose body is in here, then?

167
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,370
Who is in this coffin?!

168
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,510
Open it.

169
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,680
No way!
I don't wanna!

170
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,660
Quit your whimpering and open the thing!

171
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,820
Don't make me!

172
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,410
Go on!

173
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,050
Hurry up and do it!

174
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,900
Boville!

175
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,890
Hurry, this way!

176
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,930
Is it really okay for us to be doing this?

177
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,900
There's no other way!

178
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,510
Mama, did you hear something upstairs just now?

179
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,020
I'm not sure. Maybe your grandfather fell out of his wheelchair again.

180
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,590
And with Valentine asleep, there's no one to help him up, is there?

181
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,990
On the other hand, it might turn out to be a good rehabilitation exercise for him.

182
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,730
Watch what you're doing!

183
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,100
Sorry about that.

184
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,110
Noirtier...

185
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,430
I will keep Mademoiselle Valentine safe.

186
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,940
Is it me, or is he saying that he wants us to go that way?

187
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,200
What's this mean?

188
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,990
I don't believe it!
Was it really her?!

189
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,500
You sure were gone a long time.
Where have you been?

190
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,440
That's none of your business.

191
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,480
Oh, my!
I'm so offended!

192
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,210
Gosh, and here I was gonna give you some great news...

193
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,180
Tell me what?

194
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,890
Maximilien finally decided to put his plan into action.

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,060
The scene of the crime, Villefort Manor.
Accomplices, two. Franz and Renaud.

196
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,470
They came here to get you, but you weren't around.

197
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,500
What's the matter?

198
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,680
Commander! Commander!
This is Edouard!

199
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,910
Three criminals spotted!

200
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,500
Good work!
Apprehend them immediately!

201
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,190
And just what do you think you're doing with my daughter?

202
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,970
What are you doing in here, my son?

203
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,980
Nothing, l...

204
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,140
You seem to be doing a lot of research regarding me.

205
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,620
What is it that you hope to uncover?

206
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,620
Something about me? Or about the Count of Monte Cristo?

207
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,830
Allow me to tell you about both of them.

208
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,770
It will be...

209
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,710
...far faster this way!

210
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,850
Monsieur.

211
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,480
Monsieur!

212
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,020
What is it?

213
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,000
There seems to be some sort of commotion in front of the manor.

214
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,530
What?

215
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,830
Those kids!

216
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,540
Summon my men at once!

217
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm not the man I used to be

218
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:08,420
And what you see is not what it seems

219
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,010
I traveled through space to be with you here

220
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:23,640
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

221
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,860
You won't see me coming...

222
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,370
You won't see me coming...

223
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,370
Till I strike

224
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,260
You won't see me coming...

225
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,770
You won't see me coming...

226
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,900
Till I strike

227
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,910
The lovers depart, and new misgivings arrive.

228
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,750
Unexpected news leaves me at a loss.

229
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,530
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 11:

230
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,210
Act 11:
An Engagement Broken

231
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,190
..."An Engagement Broken".

232
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,830
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
