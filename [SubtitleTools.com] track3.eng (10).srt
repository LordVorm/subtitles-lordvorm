1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,150
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,160
The girl sleeping in the house of the poisoner...

20
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,330
...was saved thanks to the pure souls of the young men.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,210
However, the next misfortune then silently creeps up

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,570
...and suddenly appears before us.

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,010
Indeed, just like that single letter that was delivered to an innocent soul.

24
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,010
Act 12:
Encore

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,030
Excuse me?

26
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,700
Father, what did you say just now?

27
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,210
Your engagement to Albert...
I've called it off.

28
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,170
All right?

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,270
What's the meaning of this?
What brought this on?

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,580
I've been hearing some unsavory rumors about the Morcerf family.

31
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,450
But that doesn't mean you have to...
I can't believe this!

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,590
I don't understand you.

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,520
As I recall, you were never very enthusiastic over the engagement from the very beginning.

34
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,800
You don't understand anything, do you, Father?

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,290
Don't treat my life like it was one of your stocks or bonds!

36
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,310
Here's a quick lesson for you.

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,710
There are only two kinds of people in this world, winners and losers.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,010
Eugenie, I'm only thinking of what's best for you.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,910
Liar. You're thinking of what's best for you!

40
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,490
Damn it, Mondego, you really blew it.

41
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,060
Sorry, but I plan to make it through this in one piece.

42
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,000
I must say, it's hard to believe you're the Mondego I used to know.

43
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,900
You've done well for yourself.

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,140
How do you know about that?

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,320
A certain gentleman filled me in.

46
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,110
Who?! Who was it?!

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,630
Oh, I can't tell you that...
But that's not important.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,360
How much do you want?

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,870
Gimme everything you've got!

50
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,240
If you wanna keep me from talking,
stuff my mouth with gold!

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,880
It's an honor to see you again, Mademoiselle.

52
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,280
Marquis Cavalcanti? Do you have some business here?

53
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,860
Yes, I have a meeting with your father.

54
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,930
More financial dealings?

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,930
I was hoping that I might be of some assistance to you.

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,100
I want to take everything that causes you sorrow and make them go away.

57
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,600
There's no reason for you to do that for me.

58
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,150
Does a man need a reason to be in love?

59
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,050
No! Let go of me!

60
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,780
I'll scream!

61
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,160
You're acquainted with the
Count of Monte Cristo, I take it?

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,500
The gossip dealing with the Morcerf family was apparently leaked by him.

63
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,780
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,900
I must say, though, I find it unlikely that the Count's information would be incorrect.

65
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,640
Why are you telling me this?

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,140
The thought of seeing sadness on the face of the woman I love is unbearable.

67
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,050
Cut it out. There's no reason for you to be in love with me.

68
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,930
Why would the Count of Monte
Cristo do such a thing?

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,400
I wonder what she thinks about
the engagement being called off?

70
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,110
Why don't you just ask the girl?

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,980
No, this problem might be bigger than just the two of us.

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,350
Albert...

73
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,720
You're serious about her, aren't you?

74
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,700
I guess it's true that you don't realize how important something is until you lose it.

75
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,470
Goodness, this is amazing...

76
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,440
This is your daughter's big night, after all.
Money is no object.

77
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,040
My daughter is a lucky girl.

78
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,980
She never would have been able to sell out the opera house on her own merits.

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,550
This wouldn't have happened
without your gracious support.

80
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,960
So, are you willing to go along with this?
Breaking it off with Albert?

81
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,740
You can hardly call it breaking it off.
Nothing had even started.

82
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,300
Maybe, but you were engaged.

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,970
This is something that both our families decided.

84
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,910
Why do you seem so hurt, then?

85
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,480
Who is he? Who's this Count of Monte Cristo person?

86
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,010
Did the Count have something to do with this?

87
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,490
He's manipulating things behind the scenes.

88
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,520
It sounds like he was the source of all those bad rumors about Uncle Fernand that my father has been hearing.

89
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,630
Bad rumors?

90
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,230
Personally, I don't care about all that political gossip,

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,100
...but Albert hasn't been the same ever since he met that man.

92
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,710
I really miss the old days, you know?

93
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,170
The three of us would run around the meadow, not even noticing when the sun went down.

94
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,850
When did it start?

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,720
When did we start being so awkward around each other, and not even being able to hold hands anymore?

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,090
When you were on your trip to Luna, what happened to you?

97
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,320
You two haven't been the same since that trip.

98
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,780
You're right, we haven't.

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,250
What does Albert think about all this?

100
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,710
I haven't heard from him.

101
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,180
Has he said anything to you?

102
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,090
You two are best friends, right?

103
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
Best friends, huh?

104
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,970
Franz, is something wrong?

105
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm sorry. I don't really understand him these days, either.

106
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,680
Did something happen between you and Albert?

107
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,550
We got into a fight.

108
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,550
Albert shouldn't associate with the Count anymore...

109
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,220
Thanks for lending an ear.

110
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,890
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Still...

111
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,930
What?

112
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm relieved.

113
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,740
Well, whatever you might say about it,
it looks like you really do care about Albert.

114
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,180
Oh, geez...
Is it that obvious?

115
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,620
No one can hide it when they're pining away for someone.

116
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,760
Maybe the reason your piano performance that night at Auteuil was so great...

117
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,520
...was because you were really playing for Albert.

118
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,460
No way...

119
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,160
The feelings you have for someone manifest themselves in your art.

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,730
Isn't that right?

121
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah, he wouldn't be here...

122
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,490
After all, we're still fighting...

123
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,050
Yeah, he wouldn't be here...

124
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,030
What's keeping her?
Isn't Eugenie ready yet?!

125
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,460
She is still getting ready.

126
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,660
Are you sure you're feeling well,
Mademoiselle?

127
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,210
I'm fine. This is the opera house performance that I've always dreamed of.

128
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,710
It's the strangest thing.

129
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,420
Unlike the way it is outside the city walls,

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,460
...the muscat grapes here always bear fruit regardless of the season.

131
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,190
What is it?

132
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,160
Albert, you should always listen to your feelings.

133
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,300
You can't lie to yourself about how you really feel.

134
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,010
Have you always been true to yourself, Mother?

135
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,080
This is Paris.

136
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,790
Perhaps it truly is a paradise where you can find whatever your heart desires if you work hard enough.

137
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,990
But if you lose your courage, you'll simply be swept along on the currents.

138
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,110
You're not going to show up, Albert?

139
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,590
Are you looking for someone?

140
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,790
Lucien!

141
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,030
Oh, I get it. Mother invited you, didn't she?

142
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,030
Thanks to her kind influence.

143
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,130
I'm dedicating my performance tonight to lovers.

144
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,300
I hope you two enjoy it.

145
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,430
No. For tonight, you should play for yourself and for the person that you love.

146
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,870
Pianists are allowed to do that.

147
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,310
That's easy for you to say...

148
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,680
I suppose it is.

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Albert, my boy, I'm sorry, but the hall is already filled with invited guests.

150
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,510
I have an invitation.
Eugenie gave it to me.

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,710
The past is the past.
Let's pretend it never happened.

152
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,780
I was invited by Eugenie!
You have no right to turn me away!

153
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,350
Did you get that hot temper of yours from your father?

154
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,820
This has nothing to do with my father!
I'm my own man!

155
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,390
You're going to let me pass!

156
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,070
And just what are you going to do about it?

157
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,160
You have no power.
You have no money.

158
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,230
You're nothing but a spoiled brat!

159
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,570
Shut up!

160
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,960
Maybe so, but I still...
Damn it! Let me go!

161
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,830
What's this commotion?
This is supposed to be an auspicious occasion.

162
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,150
Oh, you were invited, too?

163
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,010
Yes, by Madame.

164
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,710
My wife seems to be feeling a little out of sorts.
Would you mind keeping her company for me?

165
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,940
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood today.
Excuse me.

166
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,060
Cut it out, Lucien!

167
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,530
I... have to get in there!
Listen!

168
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,730
Use your head, then!
You'll never get in through the front door.

169
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,470
Crap...

170
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't owe you any favors or anything,

171
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,240
...but I've been doing some things that are hurting Eugenie.

172
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,510
Are you really sleeping with Eugenie's mother?

173
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,340
It's all part of my job.

174
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,590
You'll never understand your whole life, and you don't have any need to.

175
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,860
Anyway, be there for her and listen to her performance.

176
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,430
You love Eugenie, don't you?

177
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,430
Let's go.

178
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,150
Albert?
Is that you?

179
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,720
You're a little late, don't you think?!

180
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,200
I was right here the whole time.
I had a little trouble getting in.

181
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,800
You don't mean my father, do you?

182
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,270
It's all right, I heard you play just fine.

183
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,970
It was really great.

184
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,610
You were radiant out there.
My heart was pounding!

185
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,080
Idiot. If I'd known you were here,
I would've been able to play even better.

186
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,860
I would've been playing for you.

187
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,160
Eugenie...

188
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm sorry. I know I'm not your fiancée anymore.

189
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,910
That doesn't matter.
I don't care.

190
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,080
Oh! Here.

191
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,950
What?

192
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,520
You like these, don't you?

193
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,760
Well, sure, but you're supposed to bring a bouquet of flowers.

194
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,870
Oh, right. I guess flowers would've been better...

195
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,500
You're such a fool. You haven't
changed one bit since we were kids.

196
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,870
Out in the meadow,
I wanted you to pick flowers for me,

197
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,040
...but you would always bring me berries instead.

198
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,350
They were delicious, though.

199
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,100
Mademoiselle Eugenie!

200
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,600
It won't do to keep your audience waiting.

201
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,600
You!

202
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,370
Wait, Albert!

203
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,740
Listen to one more song.
I'll be playing it just for you.

204
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,430
It looks like you've been shut out.

205
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,200
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

206
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,310
Ladies and gentlemen! Let's have a warm
round of applause for Mademoiselle Eugenie!

207
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,190
What do you think you're doing?!
This is my performance!

208
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,050
Yes, one that I arranged.

209
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,230
That jerk!

210
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,130
You don't know when to quit!

211
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,670
My daughter has set out on the road to a bright future! Don't ruin it for her!

212
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,940
You don't have any right to be here!

213
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,510
All the seats for tonight's performance were bought out by Marquis Cavalcanti!

214
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,540
You've lost, so go away!

215
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,560
Count...

216
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,270
Why, whatever is the matter?

217
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,170
You're not looking well at all.

218
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,280
Count!

219
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,980
Albert?

220
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm... so frustrated...

221
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,320
At how weak and pathetic I am...

222
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,390
Count of Monte Cristo!

223
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,570
You are under suspicion of criminal activity.

224
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,070
I will have to ask you to come with me to the station as the prime suspect...

225
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,770
...in the poisoning death of Valois!

226
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,500
Monsieur Villefort...

227
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

228
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

229
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

230
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

231
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

232
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

233
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

234
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

235
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

236
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

237
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,750
Villefort's investigation is relentless.

238
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,120
Why?

239
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
When I go to visit the Count, I sit and speak with Haidee for the first time.

240
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,490
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 13:

241
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,170
Act 13:
Haidee

242
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,750
..."Haidee".

243
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,130
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
