1
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,290
Get your moccoletti!
How 'bout a moccoletto!

2
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,940
Act 1:
At Journey's End, We Meet

3
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,610
Franz!

4
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,820
Franz!

5
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,050
Why, hello, Marquise!

6
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,460
When did you
arrive on Luna?

7
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,500
I made a loop around the inner planets.
I arrived only yesterday.

8
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,360
I see. You arrived just in time
to catch the end of Carnival.

9
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,770
And by the way...
Who is this?

10
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,000
Ma'am!

11
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,370
My traveling companion,
as well as my best friend.

12
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,670
Viscount Albert de Morcerf.

13
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,040
I am pleased to make your
acquaintance, Madame.

14
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,040
My... You're the son
of General Morcerf.

15
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, well...

16
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,050
Is this your first time on Luna?
I suggest you enjoy yourself, then.

17
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,830
This is a city where all your desires can
be fulfilled, no matter what they may be.

18
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,770
Apparently, he styles
himself a count.

19
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,440
But I'm not so sure.

20
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,980
Regardless, Luna's high society has been abuzz
with rumors about him this past month.

21
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,750
There are some who say that he's a nouveau riche
who made his fortune on the frontier,

22
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,980
...or that he's an alien
from outer space,

23
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,820
...or even that he's a monster
in human form, or a vampire.

24
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,690
That might be going
a little far...

25
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,900
Excuse me, but what
is he called?

26
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,130
What is his name?

27
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,600
The Count of Monte Cristo.

28
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,330
"Death is certain,
its hour uncertain."

29
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,540
Are you sure you weren't dreaming or
something? Daydreaming or whatever?

30
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,370
Get serious. This proves
that it was real.

31
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,650
And?

32
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,170
I'm gonna use it to make his acquaintance.
To meet the Count.

33
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,180
Are you crazy?
It's a huge hassle.

34
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,350
Don't do it. You have no idea
who this guy really is.

35
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,810
You think so?

36
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,640
Sure I do!

37
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,300
Begging monsieur's pardon, but are you
Viscount Morcerf from room 405?

38
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,760
Y-Yes.
Yes, that's me.

39
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,400
I have a message from my master,
the Count of Monte Cristo.

40
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,310
Well? What do
you think?

41
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,880
What do I think
of what?

42
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,680
Why would he want to talk to two
complete strangers like us?

43
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,480
His note said that he wanted
to establish friendly relations...

44
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,020
...with fellow aristocrats who were staying
in the same hotel, didn't it?

45
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,590
What a coincidence...

46
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,130
I'm not so sure.

47
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,660
There you go again.
You're such a worrywart.

48
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,430
At least stay and have
dinner with the man.

49
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,800
I have some doubts about whether
this guy is even a real aristocrat.

50
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,070
This is Luna, remember?
He's almost certainly a con-

51
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,290
How do you do, messieurs. I am called
the Count of Monte Cristo.

52
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,620
Thank you for coming.

53
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
Come now,
this won't do.

54
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,400
When a man has come all the way to Luna,
he simply must try these dishes.

55
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,170
Are you sure? We're the only ones
who are eating.

56
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,480
You haven't touched anything
all through dinner.

57
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,410
Please, you needn't concern
yourselves about me.

58
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,280
Just as journeys traveled alone are dull,
daily meals eaten alone have no flavor.

59
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,620
For me, speaking with guests as I am now
is the greatest feast I could wish for.

60
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,060
Please, help yourselves.

61
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,590
Incidentally, what did you
think of the opera today?

62
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,300
Speaking for myself, I don't
normally see operas very often,

63
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,070
...but I couldn't help being
drawn into the story!

64
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,540
Oh, I see.

65
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,210
So, Monsieur Albert, are you saying
that you have someone...

66
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
...whom you pine away for,
just as in the play?

67
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,310
No, of course not!

68
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,950
Come on, 'fess up.

69
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,980
Eugenie and I were chosen
for each other by our parents.

70
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,760
I've never been in love like the
main character of that opera.

71
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,060
It's the same with everything
else in my life.

72
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,100
Something that I can
lose myself in.

73
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,710
Something that will grab my
heart and never let go.

74
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,040
I set out on this journey
to find that something.

75
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,080
Why are you trying to make it
sound so noble?

76
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,980
As I recall, the goal of this little quest had
more to do with what's below your waist.

77
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,610
Franz! Cut it out!

78
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,190
Oh, youth is
a wonderful thing.

79
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:07,720
Endless possibilities. Hopes.
And ardent passion.

80
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,730
Count, have you ever been
in love like that?

81
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,330
I have.

82
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
What sort of woman
was she?

83
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,380
Hey! Don't be rude!

84
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,710
To be honest, I, too, once had
feelings for a certain woman.

85
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,120
As well as dreams of a future
with this woman.

86
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,580
However...

87
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,950
...all of them ended as nothing
more than dreams.

88
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,570
In short, those dreams
were only dreams.

89
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,970
And in those dreams' stead
stands the man that I have become.

90
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,350
Bertuccio!
Coffee for our guests.

91
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,470
At once.

92
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,980
I thank you for the honor
of your company tonight.

93
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,090
Not at all, sir!
The honor was ours!

94
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,530
I would like you to join me for luncheon
on my balcony tomorrow. What say you?

95
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,660
Really?
We'd be honored to...

96
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,730
We're terribly sorry, Count.

97
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,470
We appreciate your kind offer,
but we couldn't possibly accept.

98
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,730
Luna's public executions
are the highlight of Carnival.

99
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,240
The festivities reach their peak
as the blood of heinous criminals...

100
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,350
...washes away
the crowd's sins.

101
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,140
One cannot speak of experiencing Luna's
Carnival without having seen this spectacle.

102
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,420
Is that not so,
Monsieur Albert?

103
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,150
Y-Yes, sir.
You're exactly right, Count!

104
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,430
In that case, I shall await you here
in this room again tomorrow.

105
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,670
Pleasant dreams
to both of you.

106
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,910
Hey! Albert!

107
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,140
Yeah?

108
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,210
What's the matter?
You don't look so good.

109
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,360
It was cold.
His hand was as cold as ice...

110
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,690
It was like a
corpse's hand...

111
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,560
Who are today's condemned?

112
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,360
One is a man who committed murder
out of poverty.

113
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,840
One is a man who committed murder
over a love affair.

114
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,240
And the third is a man who slaughtered
an entire family to steal their possessions.

115
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,080
All three are heinous criminals
who are beyond forgiveness.

116
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,050
I did it to feed my family!
I had to!

117
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,660
My beloved wife and child,
please forgive me!

118
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,730
Please, spare me...

119
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,800
Stop that!
Stop it at once!

120
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,510
My Lord Cardinal!
I didn't murder anyone!

121
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,580
My rival framed me!
I'm innocent!

122
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,740
Please, undo
these chains!

123
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,710
You have to
believe me!

124
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,310
I bet they're just saying anything
that might earn them a reprieve.

125
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,720
I didn't do it!
I didn't do anything!

126
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,260
You moron!
Shut your trap!

127
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,830
I'm sick of you and
your damn whining!

128
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,630
As for me, I killed
ten people!

129
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,070
Women and children,
I killed 'em all!

130
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,540
How's that?! Live it up,
you bastards!

131
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,480
C'mon! I wanna see some more
happy faces out there!

132
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,790
Today's card is
most entertaining.

133
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,860
What say you?

134
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,530
Why don't we have a bit of sport
with this?

135
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,040
A sideshow to the execution,
as it were.

136
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,370
I have here
a single letter.

137
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,870
It is a letter of pardon that
was given to me by the Cardinal.

138
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,310
How in the world did you
get something like that?

139
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,280
Unfortunately, I have but
this one letter of pardon.

140
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,790
To make the choice
an impartial one,

141
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,190
...I have written the initials of one of
the condemned men on each card.

142
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
Now, please choose
one of them.

143
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,790
Come now, it's nothing more
than a little game.

144
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,300
Just a minute, Count!

145
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,810
If that's the case, shouldn't we hear
what they have to say first?!

146
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,810
My good Monsieur Franz,
we are not judges.

147
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,580
Regardless of what we do,
they are going to die.

148
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,020
I merely suggest that we make use
of that fact in order to enjoy ourselves.

149
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,590
At this moment, we have in our hands the
power to offer the hand of salvation to them.

150
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,900
Why do you hesitate to make
use of that power to do good?

151
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,970
Yes, it almost feels as if one
has become God, does it not?

152
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,770
What are you thinking?!

153
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,580
You're using people's lives
as a game?! You're crazy!

154
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,940
Come on, let's go.
Albert!

155
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,180
A game?
Yes, it is a game.

156
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,180
Our own lives are pieces that are toyed with
as part of someone else's game.

157
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,600
Has it ever seemed
that way to you?

158
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,970
I wouldn't know.

159
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,870
Let's go!
Come on!

160
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,700
I was of the opinion that you and
I would be friends, Monsieur Albert.

161
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,640
This is most disappointing.

162
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,350
You set out on your journey
in order to find something.

163
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,860
To find and grab hold of a new you.
Through the exertion of your own will.

164
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,020
Come on, Albert,
let's go!

165
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,120
Albert!

166
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,700
I'll... I'll do it!

167
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,300
Don't do it!
You'll be sorry you did!

168
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,610
It's just a game.
Isn't it, Count?

169
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,680
No! No!

170
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,390
Albert...

171
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,720
No!

172
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,470
Albert!

173
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,750
A pardon has been issued
by the Cardinal!

174
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,260
The condemned man
who is to be pardoned is...

175
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,960
...Rocca Briori,
also known as Peppino!

176
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,330
How do ya
like that?!

177
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,300
Thank you!
Thanks oh so much!

178
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,380
Long live His Excellency
the Cardinal!

179
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,790
Monsieur Albert, you have
done a good deed.

180
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,690
Truly a good deed.

181
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,690
Now, the show
is beginning.

182
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,490
Kill him! Kill him!

183
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,900
Kill him! Kill him!

184
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,330
You mustn't look away,
Monsieur Albert.

185
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,100
Not for an instant.

186
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,900
Kill! Kill! Kill!

187
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,010
Don't hold back,
Baptistin.

188
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,270
Please forgive me.

189
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,550
My vengeance...

190
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,310
...is now set in motion.

191
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,510
Hey, let's go to a cafe or something
to clear our heads.

192
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,820
Or how about hitting
the red-light district?

193
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,890
Oh, right. I forgot. Sorry about that.
You hate that sort of thing, don't you?

194
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,230
I guess there's always
the casino...

195
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,490
Please, don't talk to me
about gambling!

196
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,590
What's gotten into you?

197
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,140
You were the one who was dying
to see it in the first place.

198
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,480
And then you let the Count
talk you into...

199
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,550
I know that!

200
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,910
I know that!
I know all that!

201
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,920
"I brought this on my own head, and that's
why I'm angry! I'm angry at myself!" Right?

202
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,360
You're always fussing
over me!

203
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,460
Are you my girlfriend?
Are you my mother?!

204
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,790
Are you?

205
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,100
I'm going back to the hotel
to get ready for the ball.

206
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,710
What about you?

207
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,300
You alone?

208
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,130
Tonight is the last night of Carnival.
You shouldn't be alone on a night like this.

209
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,610
I want to be alone.
Today was the worst day of my life.

210
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
Albert...

211
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,290
Hey, don't be
in such a rush...

212
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,300
Are you going to come?

213
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,850
A passing fling on Luna.
It was a trap set by bandits.

214
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,480
Moment by moment, the hour
of death approaches.

215
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,660
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 2:,

216
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,630
Act 2:
Until the Sun Rises Over the Moon

217
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,690
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 2:,

218
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,660
..."Until the Sun
Rises Over the Moon".

219
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,590
..."Until the Sun
Rises Over the Moon".

220
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,920
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
