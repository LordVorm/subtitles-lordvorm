1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,190
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,570
A rage that is only permitted by youth.

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,700
A pure, unadulterated rage.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,700
That is the most appropriate description

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,580
...for the emotion expressed by the young soul.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,650
How exquisite it is!

24
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,790
How I desire it!

25
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,550
More! More!

26
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,810
Act 18:
The Duel

27
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,000
C'mon, baby, why not?

28
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,080
Is it because you are a soldier's son that you did not give in to fear and run away?

29
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,540
En garde!

30
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,970
Edmond... is dead.

31
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,710
This body retains only his shape and appearance.

32
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,440
There is no longer anything of Edmond himself left within it.

33
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,550
I will show you proof that Edmond, the man you once loved, is now dead.

34
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,230
Edmond...

35
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,170
It's done!

36
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm cutting it pretty close...

37
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,090
I wrote a message in a birthday card for him,

38
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,500
...but I think we're too old for that kind of thing, so I feel awkward giving it to him in person.

39
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,330
Anyway, give it to Albert after I leave tomorrow.

40
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,260
Please?
I'm begging you.

41
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,300
He should just be a man and give it to him himself...

42
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,760
I don't believe it...
It can't be!

43
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,760
Not so fast, Madame!

44
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,930
This can't be...
He's only a...

45
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:44,920
Edmond!

46
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm sorry, Madame, but I can't let you do that.

47
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,970
Please, let me go! I have a duty to keep that boy safe!

48
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,340
Please understand, this is a duel.

49
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,940
A formal duel, in which Monsieur Albert challenged the Count.

50
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,260
Albert is... Albert is still a child!
Call it off!

51
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,260
No, Madame. Monsieur Albert holds the rank of viscount.

52
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,790
In the eyes of the law, this duel is completely legitimate.

53
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,200
Edmond!

54
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,300
Please, stop!

55
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,100
Your feelings...

56
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,600
Your pain...

57
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,140
Your loneliness...

58
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,810
I'll... I'll bear the brunt of all of it!

59
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,180
Stop!

60
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,650
STOP!

61
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Countess Morcerf!
Watch closely!

62
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,020
Watch as I prove to you that
Edmond Dantes is dead!

63
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,720
Please, stop...

64
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,160
Please!

65
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,760
STOP!

66
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,980
Oh, crap!

67
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,740
Why didn't you wake me up?!

68
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,100
Franz!

69
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,280
Fran...

70
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,090
He wouldn't...!

71
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,410
This is what I've been waiting for...

72
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,210
To become Gankutsuou is to lose your humanity.

73
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,660
As the composition of his entire body is being replaced with crystal,

74
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,190
...the temperature of his heart drops and drops,

75
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,270
...until it, too, is eventually lost.

76
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,660
The instant he is released from his suffering, he will also lose his emotions.

77
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,500
Anger... sadness...
hatred...

78
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,270
He will lose them all.

79
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,650
That is what he fears above all else.

80
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,050
That is why his heart is the last part of him.

81
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,560
If he still retains even fragments of human emotion,

82
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,590
...his heart alone will be vulnerable.

83
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,770
Gankutsuou, come closer...

84
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,500
That's right...
Come straight at me.

85
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,280
Franz...

86
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,510
Franz!

87
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,860
I will now prove who the victor is...

88
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,940
Right here and now!

89
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,740
You were cursed since birth,

90
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,170
...born from the union of that cowardly traitor Fernand Mondego and Mercedes.

91
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,380
You, who have walked in the sunlight your entire life, could not possibly know...

92
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,920
...the tale of the innocent man who had his youth stolen away from him,

93
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,720
...and the old man who fell victim to loneliness and starvation!

94
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Fate has now come full circle, and the curse is about to reach its fruition!

95
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:41,170
Curse your fate, and your parents, as you die by my sword!

96
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,910
Don't do it!

97
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,580
Don't do it!

98
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,790
FRANZ!

99
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,380
I sure hope he likes it...

100
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,730
Albert...

101
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,980
The... The doctor's gonna be here soon, so hang in there...

102
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,350
Boy, you were out cold last night...

103
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,750
Those pills worked pretty good, didn't they?

104
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,060
Why? Why did you do it?

105
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:45,160
I'm sorry... that things turned out this way...

106
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:59,510
But you taught me how to handle a sword, so I put up a pretty good fight...

107
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,880
That's enough!

108
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,660
Don't... Don't try to talk.

109
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:14,090
Idiot... You think you can boss me around?

110
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,390
Franz!

111
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,030
Franz!

112
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,180
Albert...

113
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,510
I had a dream last night...

114
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,420
Maybe it was last year...
Or was it the year before last?

115
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,730
The two of us and Eugenie went to Normandy together, remember?

116
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,830
No, or was it in the south of France?

117
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,830
The three of us sprawled out on the beach,

118
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,000
...and we celebrated your birthday.

119
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:07,950
It was so windy that when we tried to eat a piece of cheese, it tasted like sand...

120
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:18,160
And Eugenie's favorite hat blew away...
She was really depressed about it, remember?

121
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,430
Happy birthday...

122
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,880
Congratulations on turning sixteen...

123
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,420
Franz, hang on a little longer...

124
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,520
The doctor's gonna be here any minute now, okay?

125
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,930
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, so hang on.

126
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,840
Say, Franz?

127
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,810
It's nice and warm out here, isn't it?

128
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,820
Franz?

129
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,010
FRANZ!

130
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

131
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

132
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

133
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

134
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

135
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

136
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

137
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

138
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

139
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

140
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,360
Alone, I walk through the darkness of the night...

141
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,670
...as I wait for the sun.

142
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,730
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 19:

143
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Act 19:
Even if I Should Stop Being Me

144
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,240
..."Even if I Should Stop Being Me".

145
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,880
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
