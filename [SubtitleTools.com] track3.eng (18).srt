1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,860
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,080
Even when wounded and made to suffer, he is reborn and gets right back up.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,530
Youth, what a formidable thing it is!

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,740
However, our resolve to have our vengeance will shatter even that.

22
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,880
Our grip on the reins will never loosen, no matter what.

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,010
Act 20:
Farewell, Eugenie

24
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,020
Monsieur. This arrived from Baron Danglars.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,600
I don't believe it!

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,630
What's up?

27
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,630
This says that the signing ceremony for
Eugenie's wedding will be held tomorrow.

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,010
He must really be in rough financial shape.

29
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,250
I can't believe he's rushing his daughter's wedding like this.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,620
Eugenie...

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,670
This won't stop me!

32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,130
Now that's just sad.

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,840
It looks like you lost your pride the same instant that you lost your status.

34
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,610
Say whatever you want about me, but you ARE gonna let me through.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,920
Unfortunately, the princess is in a bit of a foul mood at the moment.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,690
She even did this to me.

37
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,500
What the hell did you do to Eugenie?!

38
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,130
Isn't it obvious?
After all, we're to be man and wife!

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,900
She put up some fierce resistance, though.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,370
You bastard!

41
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,770
Relax, I didn't do anything as barbaric as forcing myself on her.

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,610
After all, I told her,
"By marrying me,"

43
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:44,910
"...you'll not only be safeguarding the lifestyle of your own family, but also that of the Morcerf, no, the Mondego family".

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,120
The instant I mentioned your name, she started behaving herself.

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,330
I owe you a debt of gratitude.
You're our sacred Cupid!

46
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,940
Tomorrow will go off without a hitch, I take it?

47
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,910
What about
Cavalcanti's activities?

48
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,980
Everything is going according to plan.

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,490
There is nothing to worry about.
Please get some rest.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,090
Very well.
You may go.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,290
Yes, Excellency.

52
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,470
Count...

53
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,190
Humiliation and despair.

54
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,100
Those will be my gifts...

55
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,610
...to my beloved father and mother,

56
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,320
...as well as my little sister.

57
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,400
Eugenie...

58
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,750
Mademoiselle, you look so lovely!

59
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,720
Why?

60
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,760
Excuse me?

61
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,290
Why am I wearing a dress like this?

62
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,230
Now, now... Today's affair will just be a signing ceremony attended only by family.

63
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,530
That said, I think it would be best for you to wear your formal gown.

64
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,340
Ever since I was a little girl, I never enjoyed talking with you.

65
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,270
Well, I never!

66
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,810
Eugenie! Look at you, you're beautiful!

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,770
It really does look wonderful on you.
Andrea will be thrilled.

68
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,910
I'd like to be alone until the ceremony.

69
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,550
Y-Yes, of course. Go ahead and do that. After all, things are going to become quite hectic soon.

70
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Come on, now. With him in the family, we've got nothing to worry about.

71
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,330
He's young, but that boy has nerves of steel.

72
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,780
Your performance at the opera house was most impressive.

73
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,550
For me, meeting fresh, young talent is a joy that I would not trade for anything.

74
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,290
If you are interested, would you care to come to our conservatory?

75
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Signed, F. Damrosch,
Head Instructor of Keyboard Instruments.

76
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Monsieur Danglars is a slick customer, all right.

77
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,480
He's trying to show everyone that the Danglars family's financial situation has stabilized...

78
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,690
...by inviting his stockholders and having us cover his daughter's wedding.

79
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,090
Because he'll be in effective control of Marquis Cavalcanti's fortune.

80
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,070
The real question is, what's
Albert going to do about it?

81
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,570
You think he's gonna show up?

82
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,130
He'll be here. He's not a member of the aristocracy anymore.

83
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,830
That means he's free now.

84
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Albert!

85
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm so sorry...

86
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:24,260
I couldn't disobey Luigi.
He's like a father to me.

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,370
I won't ask you to forgive me.
But at least let me do something to help!

88
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,230
Give it up.

89
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,360
I've had it up to here with people jerking me around!

90
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,920
Just like you want to save the girl you love,
I want to help the boy I love.

91
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,590
Hey, here comes the bride!

92
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,790
Eugenie!

93
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,820
Eugenie, you have no idea how long
I've waited for this day to come.

94
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,560
Very well, let us begin.

95
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,110
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now carry out the signing of the vows...

96
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,330
...between Eugenie de Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti.

97
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,840
We will begin with the groom-to-be.

98
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,040
Yes, sir.

99
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,880
You have no objections to sharing all property, bonds, stocks,

100
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,950
...and other assets in your possession with Eugenie, your bride-to-be?

101
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,820
I do not.

102
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,830
In that case, please place your signature on the marriage contract.

103
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,730
And now, Eugenie, the bride-to-be.

104
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,340
You have no objections to sharing all property, bonds, stocks,

105
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,610
...and other assets in your possession with your groom-to-be?

106
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,230
What's the matter, Eugenie?!
Hurry up and answer the man!

107
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,930
Something doesn't seem right...

108
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,770
Quiet, please!

109
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,810
I will repeat the question.

110
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,180
You have no objections to sharing all property, bonds, stocks,

111
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,910
...and other assets in your possession with your groom-to-be?

112
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm so sorry, she seems to be extremely nervous.

113
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,990
Naturally, she has no objections.

114
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,990
Danglars must really be desperate.

115
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,030
Yeah.

116
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,700
Go on! Sign the contract,
Eugenie!

117
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,410
What the...?

118
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,140
Hey!

119
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,020
Maybe I forgot to pay the power bill...

120
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,320
That's a good one!

121
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,660
Eugenie...

122
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,790
They say that Marie Antoinette, the wife of
Louis XVI, who ruled during the Middle Ages,

123
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,060
...spilled ink onto their marriage contract during the signing ceremony,

124
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,060
...as if hinting at the misfortune that would later befall her.

125
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,240
Hey!

126
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,870
This stain is saying the same thing.
I'd reconsider if I were you.

127
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,740
W-Who the hell are you?!
Who put you up to this?!

128
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,610
Nobody put me up to it.

129
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,610
This way.

130
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,490
I just don't approve of this wedding.

131
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,190
Cut the crap! You don't work here!

132
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,190
Hold it! What do you think you're...

133
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,230
What's your name?!

134
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm sorry, but this is too good a scoop to pass up.

135
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,710
Stop that, you bastard!
Give me that!

136
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,820
Monsieur Danglars, I think that he's the least of your worries right now.

137
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,260
What are the police doing here?!

138
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,390
Andrea Cavalcanti!

139
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,930
You're under arrest on charges of fraud, falsification of lineage,

140
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,430
...larceny, rape, as well as six other offenses!

141
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,930
Let go of me, you bastards!
Let go!

142
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,870
Shut your mouth, you fake aristocrat!

143
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,670
F-Fake aristocrat?!

144
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,640
Shove it, you miser!

145
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,140
Son of a...
I was so close!

146
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,480
My revenge isn't over yet!

147
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,280
W-What are you talking about, Andrea?

148
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,280
Let go of me!

149
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,090
C'mon, Eugenie, let's go!
Together!

150
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,150
This way!

151
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,690
Hey, this is...

152
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,860
I can't believe it.

153
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,340
You two are sneaking in through that hole again?

154
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,120
I secretly weakened it last night.
I made it big enough for adults.

155
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,390
I'd completely forgotten about this.

156
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,590
Let's get moving.

157
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,960
Right.

158
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,830
Hey!

159
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,680
Your chariot awaits, Princess!

160
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,130
Renaud!

161
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,090
Bye-bye...

162
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,540
Reports say that Cavalcanti has been arrested.

163
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,800
Bertuccio.

164
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,260
Excellency?

165
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,520
Do you dream?

166
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,290
Yes, just like anyone else.

167
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,760
I no longer have dreams.

168
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,530
For I no longer sleep, you see.

169
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,090
In its place, I had this golden box garden constructed.

170
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,680
But now, this room is the only place in which I may remain myself.

171
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,110
And this single glass of water comprises my entire fortune.

172
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,520
And what of you? What do you intend to do once all of this is over?

173
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,690
What I dream of... is to serve you forever.

174
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,500
But even if that dream can never be,

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,560
...there is no one but Your Excellency that I can serve.

176
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,810
When this is over, my wealth will belong to you and the others.

177
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,470
Use it in the pursuit of your own dreams.

178
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,350
Bankruptcy means nothing to me!
I still have money!

179
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,020
I'll run, and run, and keep on running!

180
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,920
Hurry up!
I'll escape all of them!

181
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,000
Boarding procedures for flight 747 to New York are almost complete.

182
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,640
All boarding passengers, please report to the boarding gate.

183
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,480
Um, I...

184
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,480
Um...

185
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,610
You go first, Eugenie.

186
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,890
No, you can go first, Albert.

187
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm sorry about the way I've acted.

188
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,660
I was always thinking of myself.

189
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,740
I never gave a second thought to your feelings.

190
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,880
From now on, no matter what happens, no matter where I am, you'll always be in my thoughts, Eugenie.

191
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,780
Albert... You'll always be in mine, too.

192
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,640
Flight 747 to New York will be departing momentarily.

193
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,470
Passengers intending to board, please proceed to gate 4 immediately.

194
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,350
Albert...

195
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,880
It'll be okay, Eugenie.

196
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,660
Whenever things get tough,
I want you to play the piano.

197
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,990
The piano that I love to hear you play.

198
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,730
I'll always be thinking of you when I play.

199
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Yeah! Show those guys in
New York how it's done!

200
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,180
Flight 747 to New York will be departing momentarily.

201
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,940
So, Eugenie's flight took off okay?

202
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,450
Yeah.

203
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,290
Is that from Eugenie?

204
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,020
Yeah. She said that she had it in the bodice of her dress the whole time.

205
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,590
She did, huh?

206
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,100
To my dearest Albert.

207
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,560
Happy birthday.

208
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,680
By the time you read this, chances are that I'll no longer be with you.

209
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,740
So instead of giving you a present,
I'd like you to hear me out.

210
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,610
Albert, this is important. I don't want you to ever hate anyone.

211
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,720
Something occurred to me.

212
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,660
Feelings of love and feelings of hate both start out as caring about someone.

213
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,990
It's sad, but I think that sometimes, when those feelings aren't returned,

214
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,460
...those feelings of love change into hate.

215
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,870
If something like that ever happens, I want you to think back to our childhood.

216
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,540
Back to a time when we could only love openly and honestly...

217
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,580
...no matter how often we got hurt.

218
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,650
I want you to go on living, Albert.

219
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,220
Love people openly without being scared of getting hurt.

220
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,650
I truly was lucky to have known you.

221
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,450
Franz d'Epinay.

222
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,660
Forever in your heart.

223
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,910
I have to see him one more time.

224
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,120
There's something that I have to talk to him about.

225
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

226
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

227
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

228
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

229
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

230
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

231
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

232
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

233
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

234
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

235
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,650
Destiny.
And revenge.

236
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,850
The merciless gears keep turning.

237
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,790
I once again find myself standing before him.

238
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,120
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 21:

239
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,540
Act 21:
The Golden Boy's True Identity

240
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,540
..."The Golden Boy's True Identity".

241
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,590
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
