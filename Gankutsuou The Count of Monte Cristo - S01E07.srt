1
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

2
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,450
When he visits
his fiancée,

3
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,910
...the young man saw a young
woman struggling to fight destiny.

4
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,430
However, none of them are yet aware of the
cruel fate that is silently bearing down on them.

5
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,890
Act 7:
The Secret Flower Garden

6
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,660
Hey!

7
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,680
Count!

8
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
Albert.

9
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,720
What happened?

10
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,750
She isn't feeling well.
Haidee is unaccustomed to crowds.

11
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,690
You needn't concern yourself.
We will meet again.

12
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,950
Let's go back in.

13
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,680
Okay?

14
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I wonder what it was
that Haidee saw?

15
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,030
She looked as if she...

16
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,350
You saw him?
You saw that man?

17
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,420
I've heard that you are
engaged to be married...

18
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,230
Yes.

19
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,530
Are you happy?

20
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,340
I... I don't think I will be able
to restrain myself tonight.

21
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,610
I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

22
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,850
I wonder if Haidee
is okay?

23
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,220
Who cares about the
Count's mistress?

24
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,320
She isn't like that.
He cares for her.

25
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,560
Like a master is kind towards
his pet dog.

26
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,800
Don't put the Count on the same level
as people like that!

27
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,670
The Count and Haidee have...
Um...

28
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,640
A relationship as two independent adults.
Where they both care for each other and...

29
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,840
Forget about other people.
What about you?

30
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,280
How do you feel
about Eugenie?

31
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,020
You're not one
to talk.

32
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,260
"The aristocracy doesn't marry for love,
they marry for money and honor."

33
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,020
Is what Maximilien said
still bothering you?

34
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,800
He was right. As much
as I hate to admit it.

35
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,700
That's how marriages work,
you know?

36
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,470
I'm not getting married
because I want to, either.

37
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,980
Baron Franz d'Epinay!
I'd like a word.

38
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,480
Why aren't you with
your fiancée?

39
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,320
How is that any of
your business?

40
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,760
Don't you love her?!

41
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,930
I like her.

42
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,340
I like her as just
another girl.

43
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,330
How can you talk
like that?!

44
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,780
Wait a minute, Maximilien!
Let me handle this. Okay?

45
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,410
If she's your fiancée,
you should love her with all your heart!

46
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,580
You didn't have to
say it like that.

47
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,150
I said what was on my mind,
that's all.

48
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,690
You're too irresponsible.

49
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,050
You're always like that.

50
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,800
I guess I'm no different.

51
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,030
I've never been in love with someone,
not like he is.

52
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,910
Albert, what do you think it
means to be in love with someone?

53
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,940
It's nothing but trouble.

54
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,010
I'll let you do what you can
to straighten this out.

55
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,290
What? Hey!
Wait!

56
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,890
Let's do it.

57
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,130
I can't go through
with it...

58
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,940
What are you talking about?

59
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Just do it like we planned,
and you'll do fine!

60
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,850
First off,
you compliment her!

61
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,510
Compliment her?
On what?

62
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,920
On anything! Her dress!
Her makeup!

63
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,790
That's Crown Prosecutor Villefort.
He's Valentine's father.

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,130
Isn't he scary?

65
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,340
Even small-time crooks get the death penalty
when he gets his hands on them.

66
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,380
That's Valentine's mother.
They're not related by blood, though.

67
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,550
Edouard! Come here
this instant!

68
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,420
Edouard, her younger brother.
He and Valentine have different mothers.

69
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,620
I don't wanna!

70
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,800
Take a look. Aren't these
beautiful horses?

71
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,830
I hate horses!

72
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm sorry, he can be such a handful.
I'm so embarrassed.

73
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,560
Is Valentine coming?

74
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,970
That girl seems to prefer
staying at home.

75
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,870
I hate Valentine, too!

76
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
They'll be coming soon.

77
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,310
It's nothing, Grandfather.

78
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,880
Mademoiselle, the Viscount Albert
de Morcerf is here to see you.

79
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,090
Hi.

80
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,000
About last night...

81
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,910
I think he has something that
he wants to say to you.

82
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,340
Go on.

83
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,910
Um...

84
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm sorry, I have to prepare
my grandfather's dinner...

85
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,150
Hey! Wait!

86
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,590
I'm in...

87
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,320
I've fallen in love
with you!

88
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,290
I love you!

89
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,070
Geez, our plans have
gone out the window!

90
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,340
That's enough from you! I'll talk to
her first, so you go wait over there!

91
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,310
I love you!

92
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,240
I think she knows that!

93
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,380
I'm sorry if we startled you.
This wasn't what we had in mind.

94
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,380
He must have been
making fun of me.

95
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,380
No! He meant it!

96
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,290
What's this all about?
Why now?

97
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,860
Maximilien meant
what he said.

98
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,030
He's just a little... clumsy
at expressing himself.

99
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,390
I don't want to hear what he has to say. I'm already...

100
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,110
Franz has told me
how he feels.

101
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,380
He says that he only thinks of you as the
fiancée chosen for him by his parents.

102
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,050
But you feel the same way,
don't you?

103
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,130
That's why he says you should
do what you want.

104
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,630
He might not have a title, but Maximilien
is a fine soldier and an honest man.

105
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,330
And most important of all,
he's deeply in love with you.

106
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm sure that he'll
make you...

107
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,070
Please leave.

108
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,980
No one... No one considers
what I want.

109
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,810
Valentine...

110
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,520
Get out.

111
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,250
I will now pass judgment.

112
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,060
The defendant is found guilty of the crimes
of larceny and insulting the aristocracy,

113
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,920
...and is hereby sentenced
to death.

114
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,800
There were extenuating
circumstances!

115
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll get no sympathy
from me!

116
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Trash like you disturb the
public order of the kingdom...

117
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,630
You have a visitor.

118
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,630
Hey. Do you miss
the outside world?

119
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,530
Are you getting along
with Valentine?

120
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,410
I've heard that you
beat her severely.

121
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,050
Who on earth
told you that?!

122
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,280
It's just a rumor.

123
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,310
I like to think that I'm attentive
as can be to that girl.

124
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,050
Just because she's the daughter of
his old wife doesn't mean that l...

125
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,260
Driver? Aren't we going
a little too fast?

126
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,890
It's not me, Madame!

127
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,170
The horses!
They aren't obeying me!

128
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,430
You are not harmed,
I trust?

129
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,560
Why, it's the Count
of Monte Cristo!

130
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,240
We have you to thank
for our lives.

131
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,050
It was fortunate indeed that I had on hand
one who is skilled in the handling of horses.

132
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,420
You look weird!
Are you an alien?

133
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,880
Don't be such
a rascal!

134
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,360
Curiosity is a sign
of intelligence.

135
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,530
We still don't know
your name...

136
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,600
This is the Count
of Monte Cristo.

137
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,770
He and my husband
are practically family.

138
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,280
I heard something about you buying
the late Prince's booth at the opera...

139
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
How embarrassing.

140
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,350
It is not my custom to attract
undue attention to myself,

141
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,720
...but there were no other
seats to be had.

142
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,950
This is Héloise, the wife of
Crown Prosecutor Villefort.

143
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,420
Then one might say that you are the
wife of Paris' guardian angel.

144
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,460
You're such a flatterer.

145
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,430
Your horses still seem
to be agitated.

146
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,960
Allow us to return you
to your homes.

147
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,980
If the good Madame Villefort is amenable,
I shall see to it personally.

148
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,010
Oh, my...

149
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,880
I've never seen her
like that before.

150
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,620
Madame has returned!

151
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,760
Maximilien! Hurry!

152
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,030
Barrois! Tea for our guest!

153
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,130
Please, that won't be
necessary, Madame.

154
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,430
Please, call me Héloise, Count.

155
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,510
Valentine! We have
a visitor!

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,520
Mademoiselle says that
she is feeling unwell.

157
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,520
Honestly, that girl...
Valentine!

158
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,260
Can't you even come out
and say hello to our guest?!

159
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,890
Valentine!

160
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,230
She is utterly miserable.

161
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,960
Maybe you're right.

162
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,130
I can tell.

163
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,470
Deep down, her heart
yearns for freedom.

164
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,550
But she is averting her eyes
from those feelings.

165
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,410
You might be right.

166
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,980
She is delicate
and fragile!

167
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,980
Can't you hear her soul
crying out?!

168
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,650
I can hear it,
all right.

169
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,220
It says, "No one considers
what I want."

170
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,160
I don't. Neither do you.
None of us do.

171
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,460
That girl is always making
trouble for me.

172
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,900
Perhaps she gets it from her late mother.
She's sickly and stays cooped up indoors.

173
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm trying my best to raise her
to be more sociable, but...

174
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,510
"She's gonna die young."
Isn't that what you said, Mama?

175
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,050
Edouard! You and
your nonsense!

176
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,560
I feel sorry for my
own child, too.

177
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,620
Valentine stands to inherit the fortune
of her grandfather, Monsieur Noirtier,

178
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,990
...as well has that of the Marquis Saint-Meran
on her mother's side,

179
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
...but this boy will
receive nothing.

180
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,800
It saddens me
to hear that.

181
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,070
Siblings should be equally fortunate,
even if unrelated by blood.

182
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
He's got fangs
like a vampire!

183
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,170
Edouard!
You're making me angry!

184
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,690
Vampire! Vampire!

185
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,160
He's a blue-faced vampire!

186
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm sorry, he's such
a rude boy...

187
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,320
Not at all, he is
a darling child.

188
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,900
To apologize for his behavior, shall
I show you to my secret place?

189
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,640
It's a modest little refuge.

190
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,540
I'm worried about her.

191
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,180
But there is nothing that
I can do for her...

192
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,350
What is it?

193
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,160
So, this greenhouse is your refuge...
It is magnificent.

194
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,130
You flatter me.

195
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,900
These flowers might be
my only friends.

196
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,840
Belladonna. Mandragora. Datura.

197
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,110
Your favorite flowers all share
a fascinating trait, Madame.

198
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,880
What might that be?

199
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,420
In each of them, their beautiful petals
conceal a deadly poison.

200
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,660
I had no idea...

201
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,530
Hey!

202
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,200
My love of horticulture grew
into an interest in botany.

203
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,860
It isn't a woman's place to be
interested in such things.

204
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,100
Could it be that you also have
an interest in toxicology?

205
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,710
Why would I be interested
in such horrible things?

206
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,350
Horrible? Why should
it be horrible?

207
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,750
Toxicology and pharmacology
are two sides of the same coin.

208
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,450
Also, nothing is more enticing
to human beings than poison.

209
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,450
Am I mistaken?

210
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,220
Poisons that steal a man's
life away in an instant.

211
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Poisons that kill slowly
and leave no trace of itself.

212
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,700
One must wonder how
many poisonings...

213
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,170
...have been consigned to the darkness,
known to no one.

214
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,300
And one more thing.

215
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,410
There is a beauty to those who have
been captivated by poison's charms.

216
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,110
Hey! Gentlemen don't peep into
other people's windows!

217
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,090
This trinket is commonly referred to
as a Borgia Ring.

218
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,490
Come. Press on the stone
and see what happens.

219
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,060
It is said that Lucrezia Borgia used
these to dispatch countless people.

220
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,930
And among her victims
was her own husband...

221
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,880
That ring belongs
to you, Madame.

222
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm so happy...

223
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
It is nothing, a mere
getting-acquainted gift.

224
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,380
Grandfather...

225
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,710
I want to go somewhere
far away.

226
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,480
To some faraway place where
no one knows who I am.

227
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,330
It's nothing but trouble.

228
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,670
Benedetto! Take a look
out the left window.

229
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,750
That's Viscount Albert
de Morcerf.

230
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,340
A party at
the Count's villa.

231
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,810
In the labyrinth, we cross paths
with a beautiful, horrible past.

232
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,050
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, Act 8:

233
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,920
Act 8:
A Night in Boulogne

234
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,610
..."A Night in Boulogne."

235
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,780
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
