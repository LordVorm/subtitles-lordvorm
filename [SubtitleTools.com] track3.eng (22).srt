1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,130
Move it!

19
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,230
We've waited and waited, but she hasn't come back.

20
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,340
Fine, let her have it her way.

21
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,270
All right, you bums!
We're heading home!

22
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,070
Back to Luna!

23
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,910
All I could do was stand there and stare.

24
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,980
At the now masterless number 30, Champs Elysées.

25
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,050
At the city blocks that had crumbled away like sandcastles built on the beach.

26
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,900
At the silent blue sky that spread out above me.

27
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,100
That's right. The summer storm had come and gone.

28
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,970
Along with the end of our summer.

29
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,020
Final Act:
At the Shore

30
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,230
Five Years Later

31
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,490
Well, well, if it isn't the good Chief Secretary.

32
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,530
So, the Assistant Editor-in-Chief came in person, huh?

33
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,970
What a hard worker you are!

34
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,280
I was just worried about whether or not you're carrying out your duties properly.

35
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,970
So, how's the peace treaty coming along?

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,610
"Treaty Nearing Finalization At Long Last."

37
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Something along those lines.

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,670
Thanks to this treaty, the restoration of diplomatic relations between our Kingdom...

39
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,150
...and the Empire is finally starting to look like a real possibility.

40
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,090
So, this marathon of a war is finally gonna end, huh?

41
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,600
Civilian interaction will become commonplace, and citizens of both nations will take each other by the hand.

42
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,330
We'll see the birth of a nation that's prosperous in the truest sense of the word.

43
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,610
Not a nation where only a select few prosper.

44
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,800
You know?

45
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,750
There's no telling when the times will change.

46
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,560
Even so, I want to believe in them.

47
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,720
I want to believe in the people who chose THIS solution at THIS time.

48
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,220
And that includes you.

49
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,860
Me, I just go with the flow with those times.

50
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,940
Well, let's leave the question of the truth of that statement for another time, okay?

51
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,870
Today's the day of our long-awaited reunion with those dear old friends of ours.

52
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,850
What's up?

53
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,770
Oh, damn!

54
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,180
Don't tell me you forgot to make reservations!

55
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,880
Sorry! Tell my secretary that I'll be late for the afternoon Cabinet meeting!

56
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,490
And tell her you're out making a reservation so important that you can't trust her to do it?

57
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,280
See you tonight at the Nouveau Casino!
We'll start off with a toast!

58
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,230
Too bad, I came all the way down here to show him this article...

59
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,460
Claire-Marie Eugenie's
Triumphant Return to Paris!

60
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,450
Max!

61
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,420
I'm home.

62
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,520
Julie! Julie!

63
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,160
Welcome home, Uncle Maximilien!

64
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,560
Spare me the "uncle" bit, okay?

65
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,260
Big brother! Thank goodness you're okay!

66
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,500
Did you behave yourselves and do what Emmanuel told you to do?

67
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course we did!

68
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,010
You bet!

69
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,410
That's good. I have presents waiting for children who behaved themselves!

70
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,810
Yay!

71
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
That's our Uncle Max!

72
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,330
All right!

73
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,900
Big brother...

74
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,580
Maximilien!

75
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,550
Dear?

76
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,260
I'm home.

77
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,170
Valentine!

78
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,340
Maximilien!

79
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,530
I've returned, sir.

80
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,230
The peace that you dreamed of for so long between Earth and the Empire...

81
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,300
...is finally about to come to pass.

82
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,110
For that reason, I resigned from the military as of today.

83
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,110
The flow of goods traveling between Earth and the Empire will grow and grow.

84
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,690
So I intend to buy back my father's ship, the Pharaon, and help Emmanuel and Julie with the family business.

85
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,420
Maximilien...

86
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,930
Hey! Maximilien!

87
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,730
Valentine!

88
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,640
If we don't get moving soon, we'll be late for the party!

89
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,900
You have an eye for quality, sir!

90
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,130
That's an import item.
All the way from Earth.

91
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
It's a brand that's famous in Paris.

92
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,780
Would it look good on black hair?

93
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,590
These models from Earth certainly are pretty, aren't they?

94
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,690
Ah, here we are!

95
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,220
I'd say that it goes perfectly with black hair, wouldn't you?

96
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,890
Peppo!

97
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,830
Forget it.
I'll pass.

98
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,030
Wha...? But sir!

99
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,300
Forget it!

100
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,700
Forget it, forget it!

101
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,000
Trinkets like that aren't good enough for our Princess!

102
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,910
It will be a whole new you...

103
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,570
Thank you, Ali.

104
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,100
Would you care to join me, Bertuccio?

105
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,910
No, ma'am. I'm on guard duty.

106
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,410
I would like to show you something.

107
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,650
What's this?

108
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,050
It says that Monsieur Albert will be arriving here on the day of the coronation ceremony.

109
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,660
And that he will do so as a secretarial aide to Earth's ambassador.

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,660
Bertuccio, what would you call this, if not fate?

111
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,140
Our old master must have guided him here.

112
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,740
So that you would be able to fulfill your duties to the best of your ability, Princess.

113
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,150
Yes...

114
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,020
Yes!

115
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,550
I also wish to keep Janina safe, so that this peace endures for years to come.

116
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,030
That desire will never change.

117
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,230
And we will be there with you.

118
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,070
Thank you, Bertuccio.

119
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,790
Air France flight 1027 from Galileo to Paris Spaceport...

120
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,420
...will be entering Earth orbit momentarily.

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,330
Our estimated arrival time in Paris will be slightly behind schedule,

122
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,670
...which will now be 2:13 local time.

123
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,880
A search is underway for the two ringleaders, Benedetto and Gaspard Caderousse, who are wanted fugitives in all systems, and...

124
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,760
In Paris, it's 2 o'clock, huh?

125
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,750
Right this way, please.

126
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,510
Are you done paying your respects, then?

127
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,510
Yes.

128
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,450
Time certainly flies, doesn't it?

129
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,620
How many times will I have heard you play now? Five?

130
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,860
By the way, did you manage to meet your friend this year? Your... young gentleman?

131
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,480
Well, then, take your time.

132
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,970
Thank you, Father. I appreciate it.

133
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,430
Hi there, Franz.

134
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,810
I just got back.

135
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,650
As I said when we spoke over the phone,
I simply wasn't able to find a buyer.

136
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,460
As such, we will be taking the house to pay for the five years of accumulated back taxes.

137
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,730
Um... "The state hereby assumes all legal rights to this land and all structures thereupon,"

138
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,500
"...and will take over management of said land and structures".

139
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,020
You're sure that's all right with you?

140
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,940
Yes, sir. I have no objections.

141
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,540
In that case, please sign this form.

142
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,940
Um... Would it be all right if I went into the mansion one last time?

143
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,120
Of course. Feel free to go in while you're here.

144
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,980
If you don't mind...

145
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,010
Franz...

146
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,810
I've been frantic these past five years.

147
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,080
I read books like crazy, always hunched over my desk.

148
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,690
And before I knew it, I'd turned 20.

149
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,420
I was... I was simply frantic.

150
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,630
I told myself that I had to live.

151
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,200
That I had to live in your place, in Father's place, and in the Count's place.

152
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,080
Franz, I was terrified.

153
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,350
Of being trapped by the past.

154
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,250
That I might become obsessed with the past and end up hating someone.

155
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
I'm sorry, Franz...

156
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,990
I'm sorry it's been so long.
I'm sorry I haven't come back for so long.

157
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,270
Mademoiselle Mercedes Herrera.

158
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,310
It has been a long time.
How are you?

159
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,810
The ship has finally begun her return voyage to Earth.

160
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,120
Unfortunately, the Captain has fallen ill.

161
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,090
I don't think that it is anything serious, but it looks as if our return will be delayed.

162
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,690
To be honest, I wish I could come home right now and hold you in my arms.

163
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,770
That day we set sail, I could see the lights of Marseilles from the porthole as they receded into the distance.

164
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,550
A day doesn't go by when I don't think back on that warm light, the light of my loved ones.

165
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,580
Guided by that light, I never lose my way or stray from my path.

166
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,430
That light that is shining so brightly in our future is happiness.

167
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,530
So please wait for me and don't worry.

168
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,260
Instead of holding you in my arms now, I offer you these words:

169
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,000
Bide your time, and hold out hope.

170
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,300
To my beloved Mercedes.

171
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,350
With all my heart, your Edmond Dantes.

172
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:15,490
You've been here all this time...
Since long before I was born, haven't you?

173
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,940
I'll never forget the time I spent with you.

174
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,100
Or the time I spent with my father.

175
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,840
Or the time I spent with the Count.

176
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,250
I swear this to you.

177
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:47,300
No matter where my life takes me,
I'll never forget that summer.

178
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,000
Never.

179
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,240
Harsh words were said and lies were told instead

180
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,950
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

181
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,170
But love could make us weak and make us strong

182
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,790
And before too very long

183
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,380
I was totally in love with you, I bathed in you

184
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,810
Lost in you, captivated by you

185
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,140
Amazed by you, dazed by you

186
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,940
Nothing can go wrong

187
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,070
Nothing can go wrong

188
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,080
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

189
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,330
Also to those we won't be seeing again

190
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,750
To those I knew and those I still adore

191
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,460
And I want to see once more

192
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,550
Debray (Domon Jin)

193
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,930
I just pray that you will love me and

194
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,100
Beauchamp (Shiratori Tetsu)

195
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,050
Trust me

196
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,140
Laugh with me and cry with me

197
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,060
Maximilien (Inada Tooru)

198
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,900
Valentine (Miura Junko)

199
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,270
Spend those silent times with me

200
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,530
Renaud (MIKI)

201
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,780
Love me ever more

202
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,280
Bertuccio (Ishii Kouji)

203
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,370
Baptistin (Tobita Nobuo)

204
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,410
Love me ever more

205
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,620
Peppo (Nakahara Mai)

206
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,710
You and I were lovers

207
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,290
Haidee (Yajima Akiko)

208
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,880
Our dreams were not soured by life

209
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,000
Eugenie (Nakamura Chie)

210
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:06,090
Franz (Hirakawa Daisuke)

211
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,340
And then my friends' betrayal

212
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,220
Fernand (Kosugi Juurouta)

213
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:12,720
Meant you never would be my wife

214
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,810
Mercedes (Inoue Kikuko)

215
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:22,400
Count of Monte Cristo (Nakata Jouji)

216
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,190
Harsh words were said and lies were told instead

217
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,570
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

218
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,950
But love could make us weak and make us strong

219
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,570
And before too very long

220
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,660
Albert (Fukuyama Jun)

221
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,160
I was totally in love with you, I bathed in you

222
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,590
Lost in you, captivated by you

223
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,920
Amazed by you, dazed by you

224
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,720
Nothing can go wrong

225
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,850
Nothing can go wrong

226
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,570
Nothing can go wrong
