1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,690
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,910
Poison has taken a beautiful girl and turned her into a sleeping beauty.

20
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:46,160
A letter from a dead man led three men back to loathsome memories.

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,330
I can hear it,

22
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,960
the beautiful melody entitled "Nightmare" that my friend is playing...

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,970
Act 11:
An Engagement Broken

24
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,510
Papa's here. Now you guys are gonna get it.

25
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,750
Please step aside,
Madame.

26
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,540
I think not.

27
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,180
I beg you!

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,130
What's the matter?
Madame?

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
Mama! Mama, what's wrong?

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,470
What's the matter with me?
I don't understand...

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Renaud! Get the car!

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,080
Right!

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,780
Heloise?

34
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,620
Heloise!

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,560
Get after them!
They've taken my daughter!

36
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,790
Catch them!

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,630
C'mon, cut it out!

38
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,830
Here they come!

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,110
Damn it!
All right, watch this!

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,480
Renaud?

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,480
Albert! Block the road!

42
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,830
Okay, that should do it.

43
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,300
Ow!

44
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,460
You're lucky that it wasn't anything serious.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
I wish that you wouldn't worry me so...

46
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,240
Cut that out!

47
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,250
For one thing, what you guys did is usually referred to as "kidnapping"!

48
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,650
Like you're one to talk!

49
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,580
Once people know why we did it,
I'm sure they'll understand.

50
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,760
But it's gonna be Monsieur Villefort who tries the case. Right?

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,860
Yeah.

52
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,090
The dead man has come back to us!

53
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,490
He would never forget what we did, not in a million years.

54
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,000
You can't sleep?

55
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,760
No. Today was a terrible day.

56
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,910
Where did you go this morning?

57
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,880
The funeral of someone I know.

58
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,450
Don't try to hide it from me. A letter from Edmond came this morning, right?

59
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,160
How did you know about that?

60
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,860
Tell me what this is all about.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,830
It was just a tasteless prank.

62
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,830
Why would anyone use that name for a prank?

63
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,600
I have no idea!

64
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,840
Edmond was accused of treason and died in the far reaches of space, didn't he?

65
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,500
Isn't that what happened?

66
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,680
Do you know anything else?

67
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,310
Please, Fernand, tell me.

68
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,950
He's dead and gone.

69
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,920
You're hiding something from me.

70
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,060
The man is dead!
I'm not hiding anything.

71
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,000
He died in prison!

72
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,800
You still can't forget what happened 20 years ago?!

73
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,070
Am I right?! Have you been thinking about that man every day for the past 20 years?!

74
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,210
Are you still in love with him?!

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,650
It was only because I was told that he was dead that l...

76
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,190
You only did what because you were told he was dead?

77
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,690
You were told he was dead, so you gave up on him and married me instead?

78
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,030
Did you?!

79
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,660
Stop it.

80
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,020
Mercedes...

81
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,500
Mercedes...

82
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,660
Mercedes!

83
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,840
The crime lab determined that the cause was a poison.

84
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,720
It's a botanical toxin of some sort. We're working as fast as we can to identify it.

85
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,810
I see.

86
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,750
Your Honor, I suggest that you exercise extreme caution.

87
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,310
The culprit might still be in this house.

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,090
I've already dismissed all the servants.

89
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,050
You don't need to worry about me.

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,090
But sir...

91
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,020
There are two things that you must do.

92
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,490
The first is to prevent news of this from leaking out to the public.

93
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,490
The second is my daughter.
Find out where my daughter is without delay!

94
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,240
The search team arrived in Marseilles this morning.

95
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,700
They will probably locate her by the end of the day.

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,170
Notify me when you find her.

97
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,970
An arrest warrant is standing by.

98
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,110
No, just pinpoint where they are.

99
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,920
Leave them at large for the time being.

100
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,380
Yes, sir.

101
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,850
Franz?

102
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,990
What's the matter?

103
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,730
I wasn't expecting you to be here, either.

104
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,100
Is there a reason that you don't want to go home?

105
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,700
Not really.

106
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,840
Want to read this letter?

107
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,810
Who's it from?

108
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,540
Maximilien?

109
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,410
The guy sure has neat handwriting.

110
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,010
Yeah, as opposed to you.

111
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,950
You're pushing it.

112
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,220
So I guess he made it to Marseilles safely.

113
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,970
Right about now, I bet he's freaking out over what he's done.

114
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,700
That's very possible.

115
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,160
Say...

116
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,980
What kind of person is Valentine's current mother? What's Madame Heloise like?

117
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,040
What do you mean? She's young, and beautiful, and intelligent.

118
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,820
Yeah, she is, isn't she?
That's what I thought, too.

119
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,130
Albert, mind if I ask you something?

120
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,550
Like what?

121
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,370
You said that you saw Madame Villefort and the Count in the greenhouse, right?

122
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,060
What about it?

123
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,800
Ever since you told me about it back at Auteuil, it's been nagging at me. That means...

124
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,400
What're you getting at?

125
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,540
Why did the Count happen to pick her to have an affair with?

126
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,320
I have to think he targeted her specifically and made his move on her.

127
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,650
And anyway, how is it that he could take one look at your symptoms and know right away that it was poison?

128
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,050
Wait a minute, are you implying that the Count is the one behind all this?!

129
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,150
I can't believe that, not for a minute!

130
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,390
If it weren't for the Count, I might not be standing here today!

131
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,340
Listen, Albert. Even if you looked all over Paris, you wouldn't find many people who just happen to have antidotes on them.

132
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,760
Not even doctors would!

133
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,170
Were you able to save me, then?
You couldn't do a thing to help, am I right?!

134
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,110
The only reason I survived was because the Count was there!

135
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,050
What would the Count hope to gain by trying to poison people? Tell me!

136
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,390
I don't know.
But I can sense it in him.

137
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,890
Sense what?

138
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,520
A deep darkness...

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Sorry I bothered you.

140
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,600
Albert! Take a good look at him!
Look at the real Count!

141
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,140
Franz.

142
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,050
I have faith in him.

143
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,850
The only one who knows the real Count... is me!

144
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,460
Encyclopedia of Toxicology

145
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,890
So, here you are.

146
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,830
You've come around?

147
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,000
What happened to me?
My memories are a jumble...

148
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,070
Oh.

149
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,580
I can't seem to shake off this lethargy...

150
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,050
That's because of the poison, don't you think?

151
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,590
Poison?

152
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,950
There's a good amount of poison
coursing through your body.

153
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,230
When did you get that ring from the Count?

154
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,970
What's this about?
What are you implying?

155
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,000
Allow me to change my line of questioning, then.

156
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,740
Have you ever seen this before?

157
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,740
I... have no idea what that is.

158
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,680
I got it out of your jewelry box.
Does that mean that this is perfume?

159
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,050
I have no idea.
It isn't mine.

160
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,200
Are you trying to ruin me?

161
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,420
What you've done can never be set to rights.

162
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,900
If it gets out that my wife is a poisoner,

163
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,570
...what do you think will happen to all that I've built?!

164
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,210
Your plans haven't run their course yet, have they?

165
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,580
Who else is there?
Valentine?

166
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,420
Answer me! How many more do you plan to kill?!

167
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,560
Is my name on your list, too?

168
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,690
That's right!
I had intended to kill you, too!

169
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,670
I only need my darling Edouard!

170
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,370
Look at you, acting like some high and mighty saint!

171
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,500
I won't stand for these insults!

172
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,580
I dare you to speak to me in that tone again!

173
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,640
I'll kill myself right here!

174
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,650
To the mighty Crown Prosecutor, the man who values appearances more than anything, there could be no greater scandal, could there?!

175
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,070
You... you don't mean to suggest that l...

176
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,140
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to drink it?

177
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,680
What kind of man are you?

178
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,850
Are you only capable of killing other people?

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,260
Tomorrow morning, you will be transferred to a hospital.

180
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,800
I've had a private room with barred windows prepared for you.

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,300
The quarters won't be very spacious, but you will spend the rest of your days there.

182
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,540
Along with your poisons.

183
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,540
Albert! Take a good look at him!
Look at the real Count!

184
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,440
I know the real Count better than anyone.

185
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,610
Count!

186
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,280
Hello, Monsieur Albert.
How are you feeling?

187
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,550
You seem to be in rather high spirits today, Count

188
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,960
So, I take it that Mademoiselle
Valentine was saved, then?

189
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,130
Right. She's recuperating in Marseilles now with Maximilien watching over her.

190
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,210
That is wonderful news.

191
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,270
Yes, but we got there too late, and Valois, their butler, died...

192
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,460
You were able to save the life of your
dear friend. You needn't feel sad.

193
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,390
And Madame Villefort has had a mental breakdown...

194
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,970
Count, why do you think those horrible things happened to the Villeforts?

195
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,670
It was inevitable.

196
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,210
There are no coincidences in this world.

197
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,740
It all comes down to karma.

198
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,700
What do you mean by that?

199
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,320
Are you saying that the Villeforts
deserved what happened to them?

200
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,850
You and I met that day on Luna.

201
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,860
Perhaps you feel that our meeting was a chance encounter.

202
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,020
But in fate, there are no coincidences.

203
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,100
Just as that setting sun does so according to the laws of the universe,

204
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,640
...fate, too, is composed of unyielding necessity.

205
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,870
There's no such thing as coincidence in your life?

206
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,480
No. There is not.

207
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,350
What I have is the power of a strong will.

208
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,860
Even if other people accept coincidences and are tossed about by them, I do not.

209
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,530
For you see, I have forged my own destiny through the power of my own will.

210
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,230
Forge your own destiny through the power of your will...

211
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,070
That is why we met, and that is why we are here now.

212
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,580
Count, I want to change.

213
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,740
I want to be a strong man like you.

214
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,910
In that case, allow me to offer you these words of advice.

215
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,020
Bide your time.
And hold out hope.

216
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,430
Bide your time...
And hold out hope.

217
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,510
Albert!

218
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,350
Why are you sitting there with that idiotic expression on your face?

219
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,040
Eugenie?
How's your mother?

220
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,140
It doesn't seem to be anything serious.
She's been in a bad mood ever since, though.

221
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,220
Oh.

222
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
But enough about that, listen to this!

223
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,230
I'm going to be playing the piano at the concert hall along with the orchestra!

224
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,000
At the opera house?

225
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,030
Yeah. My dream is finally coming true. I just got the news!

226
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,900
They've recognized my talent on the piano!

227
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,600
Congratulations!

228
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,510
Make sure you come hear me play, okay?

229
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,850
You bet.

230
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,350
That's so amazing!

231
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,110
Well, I should get back and practice some more.

232
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,850
Um, Eugenie.

233
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,650
Your playing that night at Auteuil...

234
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,760
It was... How can I put it?
It was really great.

235
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,830
You could really tell?

236
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,940
I'm glad.
Thank you.

237
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,410
Flowers for you, Mademoiselle.

238
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,530
Andrea Cavalcanti?

239
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm home!

240
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,290
What's the matter?

241
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,090
Look at this.

242
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,270
Danglars says that he wants to break
off your engagement to Eugenie.

243
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,110
But why?

244
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

245
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

246
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

247
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

248
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

249
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

250
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

251
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

252
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

253
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

254
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,180
I have to know how she really feels.
I run to the opera house.

255
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,780
I have to know how I really feel.

256
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,160
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 12:

257
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,170
Act 12:
Encore

258
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,120
..."Encore".

259
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,860
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
