1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,650
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,450
When he visits his fiancée,

20
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,910
...the young man saw a young woman struggling to fight destiny.

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,740
However,

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,040
...none of them are yet aware of the cruel fate

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,430
...that is silently bearing down on them.

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,890
Act 7:
The Secret Flower Garden

25
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,660
Hey!

26
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,680
Count!

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
Albert.

28
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,720
What happened?

29
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,750
She isn't feeling well.
Haidee is unaccustomed to crowds.

30
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,690
You needn't concern yourself.
We will meet again.

31
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,950
Let's go back in.

32
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,680
Okay?

33
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I wonder what it was that Haidee saw?

34
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,030
She looked as if she...

35
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,350
You saw him?
You saw that man?

36
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,420
I've heard that you are engaged to be married...

37
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,230
Yes.

38
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,530
Are you happy?

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,340
I... I don't think I will be able to restrain myself tonight.

40
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,610
I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

41
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,850
I wonder if Haidee is okay?

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,220
Who cares about the
Count's mistress?

43
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,320
She isn't like that.
He cares for her.

44
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,560
Like a master is kind towards his pet dog.

45
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,800
Don't put the Count on the same level as people like that!

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,670
The Count and Haidee have...
Um...

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,640
A relationship as two independent adults.
Where they both care for each other and...

48
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,840
Forget about other people.
What about you?

49
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,280
How do you feel about Eugenie?

50
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,020
You're not one to talk.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,260
"The aristocracy doesn't marry for love, they marry for money and honor."

52
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,020
Is what Maximilien said still bothering you?

53
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,800
He was right. As much as I hate to admit it.

54
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,700
That's how marriages work, you know?

55
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,470
I'm not getting married because I want to, either.

56
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,980
Baron Franz d'Epinay!
I'd like a word.

57
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,480
Why aren't you with your fiancée?

58
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,320
How is that any of your business?

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,760
Don't you love her?!

60
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,930
I like her.

61
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,340
I like her as just another girl.

62
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,330
How can you talk like that?!

63
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,780
Wait a minute, Maximilien!
Let me handle this. Okay?

64
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,410
If she's your fiancée,
you should love her with all your heart!

65
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,580
You didn't have to say it like that.

66
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,150
I said what was on my mind, that's all.

67
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,690
You're too irresponsible.

68
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,050
You're always like that.

69
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,800
I guess I'm no different.

70
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,030
I've never been in love with someone, not like he is.

71
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,910
Albert, what do you think it
means to be in love with someone?

72
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,940
It's nothing but trouble.

73
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,010
I'll let you do what you can to straighten this out.

74
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,290
What? Hey!
Wait!

75
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,890
Let's do it.

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,130
I can't go through with it...

77
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,940
What are you talking about?

78
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,000
Just do it like we planned, and you'll do fine!

79
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,850
First off, you compliment her!

80
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,510
Compliment her?
On what?

81
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,920
On anything! Her dress!
Her makeup!

82
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,790
That's Crown Prosecutor Villefort.
He's Valentine's father.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,130
Isn't he scary?

84
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,720
Even small-time crooks get the death penalty when he gets his hands on them.

85
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,380
That's Valentine's mother.
They're not related by blood, though.

86
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,550
Edouard! Come here this instant!

87
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,420
Edouard, her younger brother.
He and Valentine have different mothers.

88
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,620
I don't wanna!

89
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,800
Take a look. Aren't these beautiful horses?

90
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,830
I hate horses!

91
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm sorry, he can be such a handful.
I'm so embarrassed.

92
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,560
Is Valentine coming?

93
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,970
That girl seems to prefer staying at home.

94
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,870
I hate Valentine, too!

95
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
They'll be coming soon.

96
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,310
It's nothing, Grandfather.

97
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,880
Mademoiselle, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf is here to see you.

98
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,090
Hi.

99
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,000
About last night...

100
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,910
I think he has something that he wants to say to you.

101
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,340
Go on.

102
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,910
Um...

103
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm sorry, I have to prepare my grandfather's dinner...

104
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,150
Hey! Wait!

105
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,590
I'm in...

106
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,320
I've fallen in love with you!

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,290
I love you!

108
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,070
Geez, our plans have gone out the window!

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,340
That's enough from you! I'll talk to her first, so you go wait over there!

110
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,310
I love you!

111
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,240
I think she knows that!

112
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,380
I'm sorry if we startled you.
This wasn't what we had in mind.

113
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,380
He must have been making fun of me.

114
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,380
No! He meant it!

115
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,290
What's this all about?
Why now?

116
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,860
Maximilien meant what he said.

117
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,030
He's just a little... clumsy at expressing himself.

118
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,390
I don't want to hear what he has to say. I'm already...

119
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,110
Franz has told me how he feels.

120
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,380
He says that he only thinks of you as the fiancée chosen for him by his parents.

121
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,050
But you feel the same way, don't you?

122
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,130
That's why he says you should do what you want.

123
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,630
He might not have a title, but Maximilien is a fine soldier and an honest man.

124
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,330
And most important of all, he's deeply in love with you.

125
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm sure that he'll make you...

126
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,070
Please leave.

127
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,980
No one... No one considers what I want.

128
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,810
Valentine...

129
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,520
Get out.

130
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,250
I will now pass judgment.

131
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,920
The defendant is found guilty of the crimes of larceny and insulting the aristocracy, and is hereby sentenced to death.

132
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,200
There were extenuating circumstances!

133
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll get no sympathy from me!

134
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Trash like you disturb the public order of the kingdom...

135
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,630
You have a visitor.

136
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,630
Hey. Do you miss the outside world?

137
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,530
Are you getting along with Valentine?

138
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,410
I've heard that you beat her severely.

139
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,050
Who on earth told you that?!

140
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,280
It's just a rumor.

141
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,310
I like to think that I'm attentive as can be to that girl.

142
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,050
Just because she's the daughter of
his old wife doesn't mean that l...

143
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,260
Driver? Aren't we going a little too fast?

144
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,890
It's not me, Madame!

145
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,170
The horses!
They aren't obeying me!

146
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,430
You are not harmed,
I trust?

147
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,560
Why, it's the Count of Monte Cristo!

148
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,240
We have you to thank for our lives.

149
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,050
It was fortunate indeed that I had on hand one who is skilled in the handling of horses.

150
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,420
You look weird!
Are you an alien?

151
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,880
Don't be such a rascal!

152
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,360
Curiosity is a sign of intelligence.

153
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,530
We still don't know your name...

154
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,600
This is the Count of Monte Cristo.

155
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,770
He and my husband are practically family.

156
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,280
I heard something about you buying the late Prince's booth at the opera...

157
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
How embarrassing.

158
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,350
It is not my custom to attract undue attention to myself,

159
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,720
...but there were no other seats to be had.

160
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,950
This is Héloise, the wife of
Crown Prosecutor Villefort.

161
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,420
Then one might say that you are the wife of Paris' guardian angel.

162
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,460
You're such a flatterer.

163
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,430
Your horses still seem to be agitated.

164
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,960
Allow us to return you to your homes.

165
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,980
If the good Madame Villefort is amenable,
I shall see to it personally.

166
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,010
Oh, my...

167
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,880
I've never seen her like that before.

168
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,620
Madame has returned!

169
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,760
Maximilien! Hurry!

170
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,030
Barrois! Tea for our guest!

171
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,130
Please, that won't be necessary, Madame.

172
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,430
Please, call me Héloise, Count.

173
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,510
Valentine! We have a visitor!

174
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,520
Mademoiselle says that she is feeling unwell.

175
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,520
Honestly, that girl...
Valentine!

176
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,260
Can't you even come out
and say hello to our guest?!

177
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,890
Valentine!

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,230
She is utterly miserable.

179
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,960
Maybe you're right.

180
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,130
I can tell.

181
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,470
Deep down, her heart yearns for freedom.

182
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,550
But she is averting her eyes from those feelings.

183
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,410
You might be right.

184
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,980
She is delicate and fragile!

185
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,980
Can't you hear her soul crying out?!

186
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,650
I can hear it, all right.

187
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,220
It says, "No one considers what I want".

188
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,160
I don't. Neither do you.
None of us do.

189
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,460
That girl is always making trouble for me.

190
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,900
Perhaps she gets it from her late mother.
She's sickly and stays cooped up indoors.

191
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,710
I'm trying my best to raise her to be more sociable, but...

192
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,510
"She's gonna die young."
Isn't that what you said, Mama?

193
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,050
Edouard! You and your nonsense!

194
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,560
I feel sorry for my own child, too.

195
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,950
Valentine stands to inherit the fortune of her grandfather, Monsieur Noirtier,

196
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,990
...as well has that of the Marquis Saint-Meran
on her mother's side,

197
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,000
...but this boy will receive nothing.

198
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,800
It saddens me to hear that.

199
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,070
Siblings should be equally fortunate,
even if unrelated by blood.

200
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
He's got fangs like a vampire!

201
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,170
Edouard!
You're making me angry!

202
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,690
Vampire! Vampire!

203
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,160
He's a blue-faced vampire!

204
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,620
I'm sorry, he's such a rude boy...

205
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,320
Not at all, he is a darling child.

206
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,900
To apologize for his behavior, shall
I show you to my secret place?

207
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,640
It's a modest little refuge.

208
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,540
I'm worried about her.

209
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,180
But there is nothing that
I can do for her...

210
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,350
What is it?

211
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,160
So, this greenhouse is your refuge...
It is magnificent.

212
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,130
You flatter me.

213
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,900
These flowers might be my only friends.

214
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,840
Belladonna. Mandragora. Datura.

215
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,110
Your favorite flowers all share
a fascinating trait, Madame.

216
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,880
What might that be?

217
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,420
In each of them, their beautiful petals conceal a deadly poison.

218
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,660
I had no idea...

219
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,530
Hey!

220
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,200
My love of horticulture grew into an interest in botany.

221
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,860
It isn't a woman's place to be interested in such things.

222
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,100
Could it be that you also have an interest in toxicology?

223
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,710
Why would I be interested in such horrible things?

224
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,350
Horrible? Why should it be horrible?

225
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,750
Toxicology and pharmacology are two sides of the same coin.

226
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,450
Also, nothing is more enticing to human beings than poison.

227
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,450
Am I mistaken?

228
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,220
Poisons that steal a man's life away in an instant.

229
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,460
Poisons that kill slowly and leave no trace of itself.

230
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,700
One must wonder how many poisonings...

231
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,170
...have been consigned to the darkness, known to no one.

232
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,300
And one more thing.

233
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,410
There is a beauty to those who have been captivated by poison's charms.

234
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,110
Hey! Gentlemen don't peep into other people's windows!

235
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,090
This trinket is commonly referred to as a Borgia Ring.

236
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,490
Come. Press on the stone and see what happens.

237
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,060
It is said that Lucrezia Borgia used
these to dispatch countless people.

238
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,930
And among her victims was her own husband...

239
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,880
That ring belongs to you, Madame.

240
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm so happy...

241
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
It is nothing, a mere getting-acquainted gift.

242
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,380
Grandfather...

243
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,710
I want to go somewhere far away.

244
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,480
To some faraway place where no one knows who I am.

245
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,330
It's nothing but trouble.

246
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,670
Benedetto! Take a look out the left window.

247
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,750
That's Viscount Albert de Morcerf.

248
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

249
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

250
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

251
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

252
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

253
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

254
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

255
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

256
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

257
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

258
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,340
A party at the Count's villa.

259
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,810
In the labyrinth, we cross paths with a beautiful, horrible past.

260
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,050
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 8:

261
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,960
Act 8:
A Night in Boulogne

262
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,610
..."A Night in Boulogne".

263
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,780
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
