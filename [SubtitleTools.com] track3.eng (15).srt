1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,900
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,200
Everything lies in ruin.

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,450
What was once believed to be solid ground

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,990
...has opened up and swallowed everything.

22
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,500
The young soul wanders aimlessly,

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,670
...betrayed by everything he had believed in.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,760
But what he clutches at in the end is...

25
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,060
Act 17:
The Confession

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,510
Someone taught me the meaning of the word hope.

27
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,510
Count, that someone was you!

28
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,960
Wait for me, Albert!

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,970
Mademoiselle.

30
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,440
A letter has arrived for you.

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Thank you.

32
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,490
Why aren't you saying anything?

33
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,100
Why aren't you answering me?

34
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,600
My words now fall on deaf ears.

35
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,400
Is... Is that what you're trying to say?!

36
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,280
There is no such thing as coincidence.
I believe that is what I told you.

37
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,820
As I recall, it is the very first thing I told you.

38
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,520
Everything that happens does so out of necessity.

39
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,290
What are you trying to say?

40
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,220
Tell me, if Haidee were not a living witness to your father's true identity,

41
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,870
...what value would there be in keeping her with me?

42
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,540
Tell me, if you were not
Mondego's son,

43
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,480
...why would it have been necessary for me to meet you on Luna?

44
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,310
It can't be...

45
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,990
From the very beginning, you were using me?

46
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,390
Yes. I met you under the pretense of coincidence,

47
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,400
...and took advantage of this so-called
"friendship" that you have such faith in.

48
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,140
That is what
I am saying.

49
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,700
I even used props such as that watch.

50
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,810
It can't be...

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,280
From the very beginning, you were using me?

52
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,310
You're lying!

53
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,010
You're lying! You're lying!

54
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,420
I can't believe that everything has been a setup since the very beginning!

55
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,630
I can't!

56
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,720
I mean, haven't you always helped me, Count?

57
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,460
Haven't you always been looking out for me?

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,640
I don't believe that all the time we spent together was a lie!

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,570
Not one bit!

60
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,670
You poor, foolish boy.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,870
You still wish to remain immersed
in those naive delusions of yours?

62
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,100
Is that what you are trying to say?

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,010
Even if I deliberately brought you with me on that pleasure cruise that day,

64
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,130
...knowing full well that Haidee was about to disclose the truth at the National Assembly?

65
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,540
I must thank you.

66
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,370
You have been most useful to me in the time we have known one another.

67
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,980
You have my gratitude.
From the bottom of my heart.

68
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,980
I challenge you!

69
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,680
My, how old-fashioned.

70
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,350
The son of a soldier must act in accordance with tradition?

71
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,690
Is that it?

72
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,660
The time will be tomorrow morning at five.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,460
In the forest of Boulogne.

74
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,430
Weapons?

75
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,670
Armor and bare steel!

76
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,260
Very well.

77
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,100
Bertuccio.
You are my witness.

78
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,210
Did you see the whole challenge from beginning to end?

79
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,940
Y-Yes, Excellency!

80
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,750
Albert!
I accept your challenge.

81
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,480
In that case, we will meet at five tomorrow!

82
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,960
It will serve to freeze the memory of this day, this hour, in time.

83
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,830
A memory which belongs to us alone.

84
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,850
I must go see him.

85
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:17,530
Count, is there nothing I can do to stop this duel between you and Albert?

86
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,040
You told me that I am free.

87
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,820
That is what allowed me to live to this day without taking my own life.

88
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,960
But if you... If you were to perish,

89
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,000
...I would not be able to go on living, either.

90
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,110
Gankutsuou...

91
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,610
Wait... Not yet!

92
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,140
It is not yet time!

93
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,270
Franz?

94
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,510
Albert!

95
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,320
Franz...

96
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,160
You've always looked out for me,

97
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,060
...but I'd always plunge ahead with what
I was doing, ignoring your advice.

98
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,670
I'm sorry...
I'm so sorry, Franz.

99
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm back.

100
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,540
Welcome home.

101
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,610
Geez, wipe the snot from your nose.

102
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,460
Get off my back!

103
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,520
You total idiot! You played straight into his hands!

104
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,530
You've got to call off this duel right now!

105
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
Cut it out!

106
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,200
You'll act as my second, right?

107
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,910
I don't blame you for being angry.

108
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,310
But this is one thing that I have to see through, no matter what!

109
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,220
Listen to me, and listen good.

110
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,130
The Count has been planning to kill you all along.

111
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,720
Are you saying that you don't care if you end up getting killed in the name of his revenge?!

112
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,710
Franz.

113
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,950
That bastard deceived me and used dirty tricks to lure me in.

114
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,160
He used the most despicable means imaginable to toy with me and turn my life upside-down.

115
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,370
And I can't... I can't let him get away with it!

116
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,940
Even if the Count used to be your mother's fiancé?

117
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,420
Your father was so in love with your mother...

118
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,120
...that 25 years ago, he framed the Count
for a crime he didn't commit...

119
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,490
...and took his fiancée away from him by force.

120
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,660
Edmond Dantes?

121
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,450
Mondego's wife is here to see you.

122
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,550
Edmond!

123
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,890
No, Count...

124
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,260
You are really Edmond Dantes, aren't you?

125
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,330
How I've missed you...

126
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:08,900
These past 25 years, I haven't forgotten you for an instant.

127
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,310
I know that you can never forgive what I've done.

128
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:25,250
But... But even if only once, I wish I could speak with you as Edmond!

129
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,370
Edmond... is dead.

130
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,940
This body retains only his shape and appearance.

131
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,240
There is no longer anything of Edmond himself left within it.

132
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,320
That's not true.

133
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,090
No, that isn't possible!

134
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:07,660
If that were so, why have I had the feeling ever since the day we met that you are Edmond?

135
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,680
You refuse to be disturbed by the coldness of my hand...

136
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,820
You leave me no choice, then.

137
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:43,770
I will show you proof that Edmond, the man you once loved, is now dead.

138
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:55,670
I will await you at five tomorrow morning in the forest of Boulogne.

139
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
It's already too late for that, Franz.

140
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,210
It's too late to do anything!

141
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,480
Whatever happened between the Count and our fathers in the past,

142
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,250
...I don't care about any of that anymore!

143
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,050
I can't take back what happened between the Count and me.

144
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,650
If he hates me that much, he should just kill me and be done with it!

145
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,380
Damn it!

146
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,290
He played games with my feelings!

147
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,430
Albert! Don't do it!
Don't go!

148
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,760
Come back!

149
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,530
Albert!

150
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,300
Please, come back...

151
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,350
You're still going to go see him, even knowing who he is?

152
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,260
Hi!

153
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,560
Franz! You're back!

154
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,860
Welcome home!

155
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,270
Is Albert here?

156
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,280
Uh... No, he was with me until a while ago.

157
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,990
He said that he had something to take care of.

158
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,450
Oh, he did?

159
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,510
Still, I'm glad to see you. I haven't been able to reach you since that day.

160
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,950
Sorry for worrying you.

161
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,550
Honestly! I was worried sick about you.

162
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,530
You timed your arrival perfectly, Franz.

163
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,240
Franz, don't you remember?
Tomorrow is Albert's birthday!

164
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,980
Yeah, exactly! That's why!
That's why I came to see you!

165
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,110
Geez, get your act together...

166
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,090
Actually, about that...
I wrote a song for Albert!

167
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,180
It's not finished yet, though.

168
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,210
Well?

169
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,510
Yeah, it's nice.

170
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,350
It's romantic.
Not like you at all.

171
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,850
What's that supposed to mean?!
Don't be rude!

172
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,830
That settles it! Tomorrow, you, Albert and I will have a party at our usual cafe!

173
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,870
But I can't...

174
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,010
Just say that a friend of yours is having a recital or something, and sneak out.

175
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,350
It'll all work out.

176
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,010
Okay, I get it.

177
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,020
So anyway, do you think you could do me a little favor?

178
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,220
As in?

179
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,880
I wrote a message in a birthday card for him,

180
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,130
...but I think we're too old for that kind of thing, so I feel awkward giving it to him in person.

181
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,670
Idiot, who cares how old you are?
You're just giving him a card.

182
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,710
Anyway, give it to Albert after I leave tomorrow.

183
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,640
Please?
I'm begging you.

184
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,270
It must be a surprise.
Sure, okay.

185
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,190
Okay, I think I'll keep working on that song for a while.

186
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,260
Don't work too hard.
See you tomorrow at 3 PM, then.

187
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,960
At our usual cafe.

188
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,600
Thanks for coming by to visit me today.

189
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,710
Excellency.

190
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,910
What is it?

191
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,090
Good luck.

192
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,820
Let's drink to victory with a red!

193
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,120
I'll have the white!

194
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,990
But that guy up there is pitch-black!

195
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,060
To victory!

196
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,600
To victory!

197
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
Right!

198
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm gonna mop the floor with that coward, just you watch!

199
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,370
The Count is no one to fear!

200
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

201
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

202
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

203
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

204
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

205
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

206
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

207
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

208
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

209
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

210
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,300
The clash of steel shatters the dawn silence.

211
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,740
Sword of righteous anger in hand,
I shall cut through all deception and lies!

212
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,220
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 18:

213
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,410
..."The Duel".

214
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,460
Act 18:
The Duel

215
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,890
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
