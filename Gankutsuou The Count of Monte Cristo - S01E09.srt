1
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

2
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,650
My friend invited three families to his villa,
where a forbidden past lay dormant.

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,190
When that soul which had been
interred there returned to life,

4
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,860
...I sensed clearly that a new vengeance
was about to sprout.

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Act 9:
I Dreamed A Dark Dream

6
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,090
Somebody!

7
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,460
Somebody, send for
a doctor!

8
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,600
What's the matter?

9
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,880
It's Madame Danglars!

10
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,120
She's collapsed!

11
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,300
What the hell
are you after?!

12
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,110
What's your game?!

13
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,780
Surely you jest. My only goal is to
have my guests enjoy the party.

14
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,120
You've gone too far! This manor was
originally owned by my father-in-law.

15
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,290
If you're deliberately trying to insult me,
I'll make you regret it!

16
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,740
Even though I was unaware of that fact,
I have indeed been most rude.

17
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,870
Still, this is a
most fascinating,

18
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,850
...not to mention
most odd, coincidence.

19
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,990
Which means, then, that this place is as
familiar to you as the back of your hand.

20
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,530
In which case, my little entertainment
was unfair from the very beginning.

21
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,530
This simply won't do.
Shall we start over and try it again?

22
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,540
What in the world happened, Albert?

23
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,510
I'm not really sure.

24
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,380
As part of the game, I was about to give
Madame Victoria the box with the prize in it,

25
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,150
...and the instant I did, she...

26
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,830
What in the world
made her faint?

27
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,570
H-How can this be?

28
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,700
Dear boy, forgive me...

29
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,270
It seems to be a case of anemia.
It is nothing serious.

30
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,640
I'll ask you again.
Who ARE you?

31
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,150
Exactly what do
you know?

32
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,220
Your life depends on
your answer.

33
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,450
Answer me!

34
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,520
I am but a poor bumpkin who has come from
the far reaches of Eastern Space.

35
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,700
Other than that, I have no past
which is worth speaking of.

36
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
None at all.

37
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,180
Victoria!

38
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,980
Victoria! What's happened
to her?!

39
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,380
You needn't worry.
She is merely feeling out of sorts.

40
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,750
Hey! Honey! Hey!

41
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,820
I expect that a few moments' rest
will have her feeling good as new.

42
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Is that not right?

43
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,140
Where's Eugenie?

44
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,730
Let's look for her!

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,000
Eugenie!

46
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,370
Eugenie!
Where are you?!

47
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,880
Father! Eugenie!

48
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,520
You there!

49
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,490
Do you know where Eugenie is?
She's Monsieur Danglars' daughter.

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,200
I've heard stories about you
from the Count.

51
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,430
All sorts of things.

52
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,360
So, you're Albert, son of
the Morcerf family...

53
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,240
Where's Eugenie?
Isn't she with you?!

54
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,250
She's already headed towards the inner
chambers, both she and your father.

55
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,390
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear to you.

56
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:15,190
In all the world, I am the only person capable
of understanding the Count's feelings.

57
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,700
Wha...?

58
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,000
Now, if you'll excuse me.

59
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,050
Count!

60
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,150
Give me your hand, sir.

61
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,650
My thanks, Bertuccio...

62
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,260
What are those markings...?

63
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,790
I'd ask you not to overexert yourself,
but I'd probably be wasting my breath.

64
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,890
Do you have it in you to follow me?
Into the darkest depths of Hell?

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,940
Of course. I'll be at your side
wherever you go, Gankutsuou.

66
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,120
Gankutsuou?

67
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,320
Mother...

68
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,990
I'm all right.
I'm fine now.

69
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,830
I'm sorry if I worried you.

70
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,350
Valentine!

71
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,190
Albert!

72
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,630
I'm sorry
about earlier.

73
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,720
I got carried away without stopping
to consider your feelings.

74
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,070
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
I said such rude things.

75
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,570
Still, I'm glad. It's nice that you two
can have a normal conversation now.

76
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,610
I... had misjudged him.

77
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,150
I'm glad we had this
chance to talk.

78
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,120
As am I!

79
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,630
Now that all the excitement's over,
I feel kinda...

80
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,700
Albert?

81
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,670
Monsieur Albert?

82
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
Hold on!

83
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,110
Monsieur Albert!

84
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,850
Monsieur Albert!

85
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,230
How are you feeling?

86
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
It feels like a weight on my chest
has been lifted.

87
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,390
I am glad to hear it.
I mixed this medicine especially for you.

88
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,240
Nothing is better for the
treatment of chest pains.

89
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,310
I'm sorry if I made
any trouble for you.

90
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,710
For some reason, I felt sick
all of a sudden...

91
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,750
What could be wrong
with Albert?

92
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,950
Ever since we were kids,
he's never had so much as a cold.

93
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,080
You and Albert are
childhood friends, aren't you?

94
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,620
Yeah.

95
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,090
I heard all about it from
Mademoiselle Valentine.

96
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,870
She said that she has always been jealous
of how close you two are.

97
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,500
It's just because we've known
each other for so long.

98
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,600
It's not just because you're
old friends, is it?

99
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,010
I somehow get the impression that you two
share a bond that no one else can share in.

100
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,690
Speaking of which, how long have
you had feelings for Valentine?

101
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,520
That's an awkward question
to be asked by her fiancée.

102
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,320
Of course, you're right.
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,600
No, I am the one who
is at fault here.

104
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,530
But if you love her, that should be
all that matters.

105
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,810
There you go, saying such
irresponsible things again...

106
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,510
Irresponsible, huh?
I suppose it is.

107
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,050
It's a strange thing.

108
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:09,390
Why can't you love Mademoiselle Valentine?
She is your fiancée, after all.

109
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,530
What about you? Will you stop loving her
just because you can't marry her?

110
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,890
As to that...

111
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,900
You can't, can you? You can't simply
fall out of love, can you?

112
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,670
Even if it's a relationship where
you can't marry the person.

113
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,910
Are you saying that you harbor
a hopeless love for someone, too?

114
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,420
Marriage isn't necessarily the only way
to make that person happy.

115
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,410
Don't you think?

116
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,020
I hadn't thought of that...
Perhaps you're right.

117
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,600
Valentine's found herself
a great guy.

118
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,110
Albert.

119
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,410
Sir?

120
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,500
I realize that this is an odd question,
but what have you eaten today?

121
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,850
Actually, I've been so busy today
that I haven't eaten anything at all.

122
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,350
But now that you mention it, I drank some
water from the table with the blue flowers.

123
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,220
The table with blue flowers was
the Villefort family's table.

124
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,760
Do you think that has
anything to do with it?

125
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,590
Albert, I would like you
to remain calm and listen to me.

126
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,700
What had been attacking
your body... was poison.

127
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,440
Poison?

128
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,340
Yes, a fearful poison that is called
"zhen-du" in Eastern Space.

129
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,510
You're saying that the
water was poisoned?

130
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,620
It would be safe
to assume so.

131
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,990
You managed to survive because the ice
had melted, thus diluting the poison,

132
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,350
...but you nevertheless
had a close call.

133
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,830
Who would do
such a thing?

134
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,660
I suspect that you were
not the target.

135
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,860
Right. The poison was mixed
into that water pitcher,

136
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,860
...so that means the target
was the Villefort family.

137
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,910
But why?

138
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,580
Feelings of hatred and jealousy
towards another...

139
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,720
...are emotions which silently fester and grow,
unbeknownst to the object of their affection.

140
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,180
The happier that person is,
the less aware he is of their feelings.

141
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,820
However, their attempt
ended in failure.

142
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,450
Which means that they
will lay another trap to...

143
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,630
They can't! There are people
that I want to be happy!

144
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,000
Albert, are you sure you
should be out of bed?

145
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,470
I feel fine now.
Sorry I made you worry.

146
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,540
Still, I think you should
take it easy.

147
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,650
He's right,
Monsieur Albert.

148
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,410
No, we have
to hurry.

149
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,520
I'll explain later. Anyway, we have
to get to Valentine's house.

150
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,490
To Mademoiselle
Valentine's house?

151
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,940
Yeah.

152
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,330
You're such a
frightening man...

153
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,600
And at the same time,
so very alluring...

154
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,890
Are we clear on this,
Boville?

155
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,700
Use every network at your disposal and find out
everything there is to know about that man.

156
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,400
Focus your investigation
on Marseilles in particular.

157
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,970
Understood.

158
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,270
"Count of Monte Cristo," my ass. Mark my
words, I'll find out who you really are.

159
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,290
Incidentally, what is your connection
to this man, Your Honor?

160
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,290
That isn't something that you need
to concern yourself about.

161
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,220
Yes, sir. But I suggest that
you be mindful of rats.

162
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
Yes, I know.

163
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,730
I'll be off, then.

164
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,610
Look, Grandfather.
Isn't this a beautiful rosary?

165
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,460
Pardon me.

166
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,630
I've brought you something
to drink.

167
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,900
Thank you, Valois.

168
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,190
Still, don't you think the Count
is reading too much into this?

169
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,460
I mean, come on, someone's trying
to kill the Villefort family?

170
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,190
He's not like other people.
I believe him.

171
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,230
Say, Franz...
Will you hear me out?

172
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,240
What's up? You sound
awfully serious.

173
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,840
The thing is, I finally
figured something out.

174
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,510
Well? What is it?

175
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,040
You might laugh at me for
saying this, Franz,

176
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,550
...but I really do think it's important for
the two people to love each other.

177
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,990
What's gotten into you?
What brought this on?

178
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,750
Well, I... It's just that I want Valentine
and Maximilien to be happy.

179
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,300
I know it's more complicated
than that for you, though.

180
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,960
Not at all. I want the same
thing with all my heart.

181
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,440
If it's humanly possible, I think two people
who love each other should be together.

182
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,770
You do, huh?

183
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,140
The love those two have is the real thing.
I want them to be happy.

184
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,110
No way am I gonna let
anybody poison her!

185
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,550
The rain has certainly
gotten stronger...

186
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,490
It's rather humid,
isn't it?

187
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,630
You must be hot, Valois.
Would you like a glass, too?

188
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,200
Eh? No, I couldn't possibly,
Mademoiselle.

189
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,370
It's all right, don't stand
on ceremony.

190
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,880
Valois!

191
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,420
Valois, what's the matter?
Valois!

192
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,190
M-Mademoiselle...

193
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,560
Valois?

194
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,990
Valois!

195
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,500
W-What happened?

196
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,300
Grandfather...

197
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,840
Hurry!

198
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,510
Hurry, call the doctor!

199
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,350
Mademoiselle Valentine!

200
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,780
How can this be?
Mademoiselle Valentine!

201
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,530
I can't believe it.
It's just like the Count said.

202
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,500
What the hell
is going on?

203
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,140
I'll be back.

204
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,570
Where are you going?

205
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,300
Where else?
To go see the Count.

206
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,840
He might be able to do
something for her.

207
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
Hey, Albert!

208
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,080
Albert...

209
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,690
I'll be at your side wherever
you go, Gankutsuou.

210
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,930
I'm sorry, but His Excellency is away
on a business trip at the moment.

211
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,740
You're kidding!
When will he be back?

212
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,250
That is entirely up to His Excellency.
I'm sorry I cannot be of more help.

213
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,550
I see that you're helpless by
yourself, same as always.

214
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,820
You!

215
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm looking forward to seeing
how this turns out.

216
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,530
What's that supposed
to mean?

217
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,460
Do you have the courage to learn
what the future holds?

218
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,400
Who the hell you?

219
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,590
Damn it!
What am I gonna do?

220
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,500
Don't die, Valentine!

221
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,710
You child of illicit love who has
awoken from a dark dream...

222
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,890
...and come back to life
from the depths of death...

223
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,390
You beautiful child who knows nothing
of love, nor of being loved.

224
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,930
Thou art anathema.

225
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,040
Thou art anathema!

226
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,320
A dark cloud spreads out like
a stain to cover our lives.

227
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,280
And a letter arrives from an old friend
who was thought to be dead.

228
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,520
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo act 10:

229
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,880
Act 10:
The Letter From Edmond

230
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,860
..."The Letter
From Edmond."

231
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,160
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
