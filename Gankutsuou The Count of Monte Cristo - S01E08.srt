1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,900
When he steals into a mansion with a friend
in order to help him win over his love,

2
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,000
...the young man witnesses a physical
liaison between two adults.

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,070
My friend said to me,
"He must know."

4
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,070
"Until the day his innocent soul
is destroyed."

5
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,010
Act 8:
A Night in Boulogne

6
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
This is bad...

7
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,080
Albert!

8
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,790
W-What are you
barging in here for?!

9
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm sorry. I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.

10
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,500
You have a visitor from
the Champs Elysees.

11
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,670
The Count?

12
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,340
His Excellency says that he does
not wish to see you today.

13
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,240
Did he give you a message
or something?

14
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,270
No, Monsieur, nothing
in particular.

15
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,980
I see...

16
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
What's this?

17
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,040
His Excellency wishes
to unveil his new villa.

18
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,640
That is an invitation to a dinner party.
By all means, bring your entire family.

19
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,680
With pleasure!
Where is the villa?

20
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,620
The forest of Auteuil.

21
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,950
He has a villa in
that gloomy place?

22
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,420
Yes. His Excellency insisted
on this villa in particular.

23
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:30,210
If I'm not mistaken, Monsieur Villefort
used to own this villa.

24
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,780
It's almost fallen
to ruin.

25
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,380
While his first wife was still alive,
it was a bright, cheerful place.

26
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,260
You mean Valentine's
real mother?

27
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,730
She was still so young and
beautiful when she died.

28
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,320
Thank you for coming.

29
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,850
My lord General.

30
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,890
Thank you for
inviting us.

31
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,630
Count!

32
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,160
Well, well! The good
Madame Villefort!

33
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
This is my husband, the...

34
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,010
The Crown Prosecutor,
I presume?

35
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,480
I'm told that you did a great
service for my wife and son.

36
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,320
I am honored that you have gone
to all the trouble of coming here.

37
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,820
This manor is a little too dreary to
invite guests over, don't you think?

38
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Not at all, I have taken quite
a liking to the silence here.

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Now, I see that the three gentlemen who
embody Paris are gathered here tonight.

40
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,630
Monsieur Danglars,
the king of bankers.

41
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,770
General Morcerf, who commands
the military.

42
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,870
And you, Monsieur, who
administers the law.

43
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,080
There is a reason that I invited you here
to this humble affair tonight.

44
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,590
Allow me to be frank and
make a confession to you.

45
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,330
Travelers are insecure
by their very nature.

46
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,630
I would like to forge bonds of friendship
with you three gentlemen.

47
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,640
I am given to understand that you hope
to win the presidency, General.

48
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,410
Where did you
hear that?!

49
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,680
I would like to assist you to the best
of my humble abilities.

50
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,640
Albert. Leave us
for a moment.

51
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,090
What? But l...

52
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,020
We adults need to have
a discussion.

53
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,560
Albert, what's the matter?
You look a little out of it.

54
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,610
You don't look well.

55
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,080
No, I'm fine, Mother.

56
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm sorry I forced you
to come.

57
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,990
I wonder if the Count
is avoiding me...

58
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,260
At Valentine's house,
I saw something.

59
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,710
I saw the Count and Madame Villefort
being... intimate.

60
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,470
So?

61
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,450
While I was watching,
the Count spotted me.

62
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,420
It seemed that way
to me, anyway.

63
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,280
What about it?

64
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,450
I'm a terrible person...

65
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,560
I guess the Count has
a lot on his plate.

66
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,600
It just means that he's
a man like any other.

67
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,340
Anyway, weren't you supposed to go there to
work out the whole Maximilien situation?

68
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,870
That's the least of my
worries right now.

69
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,140
Um...

70
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,340
Would it be all right
if I joined you?

71
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,850
Who is this?

72
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,210
I'm going outside for
some fresh air.

73
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,850
Um, might l...

74
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,460
What the hell
did you do?

75
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,300
And who might
you be, boy?

76
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,870
M-Me, sir? I am...

77
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,970
This is Captain Maximilien Morrel,
a most capable soldier.

78
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,510
How do you do, sir?

79
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,270
I'm Captain Maximilien Morrel,
Canes Venatici Gamma Army.

80
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,110
My family operates a trading
firm in Marseilles. As for me, l...

81
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,480
And what do you want?

82
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,920
Sir. I-I would like to ask for
your daughter's hand in...

83
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,260
Yours is a noble profession,
one which defends the state.

84
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,860
For that, I offer you
my respects.

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,760
Nevertheless, you are
a simple commoner.

86
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,270
And my daughter
is already engaged.

87
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,570
I suggest that you bear
those facts in mind.

88
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,840
How rude!

89
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,970
Bouillabaisse Ã  la Marseilles.

90
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,720
So, how did the marriage
proposal go?

91
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,690
Dead on arrival.

92
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,200
You know, maybe she really
has feelings for you.

93
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,030
And what's this secret
conversation about?

94
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,030
Beauchamp!

95
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,510
You've got guts, firing off a flash
at the Crown Prosecutor like that.

96
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,870
When I see a guy who's full of himself,
my rebellious streak takes over.

97
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,650
So, what's up?
The sorrows of youth?

98
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,120
Geez, what a sad world we're living in.
It's all "love" this and "affairs" that.

99
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,650
Look at that.

100
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,520
Rumor has it that those two were
having an affair years ago, too.

101
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,060
The Crown Prosecutor
and Eugenie's mother used to...

102
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,570
Forgive me for imposing
on you.

103
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,660
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

104
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,970
I've paid a small fortune
for her lessons.

105
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,300
It's only fair that she should put it
to good use at times like this.

106
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,450
Please listen to what
I have to say.

107
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,650
I'd like to apologize
to you.

108
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,890
What I said the other day was terrible.
I didn't give any thought to your feelings.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,870
What did Valentine say?

110
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,090
She was crying.

111
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,350
I guess I made you do my
dirty work for me. I'm sorry.

112
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,110
Valentine loves you.

113
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,450
You're kidding!

114
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,910
She does!

115
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm sure of it.

116
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,520
Eugenie's gotten really good,
hasn't she?

117
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,690
Hey, don't try to change
the subject.

118
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,800
I talked to her
the other day.

119
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,970
I bet she had a lot of bad things
to say about me.

120
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
Pretty much.

121
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,000
What's that mean?
Tell me! C'mon, tell me!

122
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,450
What do you want from me
after all this time?

123
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm frightened.

124
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,580
What if someone
sees us?

125
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,550
But when we're here, I can't help
but think of our child!

126
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,010
Magnificent.

127
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,880
I see that music is truly
your calling.

128
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,860
Her calling, huh? The Count must
know a lot of talented people.

129
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,090
Thank you for the lovely performance,
my lovely lady.

130
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,500
How do you do?

131
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,950
Now that one talented youth has made her
debut, allow me to introduce another.

132
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,780
This is Marquis Andrea Cavalcanti.

133
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,050
Oh, my...

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,190
That family had
an heir?

135
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,760
His father is an old friend
of mine.

136
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,290
If you would welcome him as you have done
me, nothing would make me happier.

137
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,700
I realize that I am an untested youth who only
recently inherited his late father's estate,

138
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,900
...but I am honored to
make your acquaintance.

139
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,880
Look at that brooch!
It easily cost five million!

140
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,340
Who's that guy?

141
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,020
The Count's new favorite, I'd say.

142
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,780
I bet he has all kinds
of talents!

143
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,950
Well, ladies
and gentlemen.

144
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,000
I do hate to interrupt your conversation,
but if I might have your attention please?

145
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,730
One of the reasons that I
purchased this estate...

146
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,700
...was that I wished to escape from the noise of
the city and spend time in quiet contemplation.

147
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,770
But on the contrary,
once I arrived here,

148
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,410
...I found myself fascinated by a certain
aura that pervades this old mansion.

149
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,150
And what might
that be?

150
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,120
How might one
best describe it?

151
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,850
Yes... In a word...

152
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,240
...a curse.

153
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,500
I found myself pondering
certain questions.

154
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,330
What sorts of lives were led by
the people who once lived here?

155
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,970
And what sad events occured here that
were hidden away from the eyes of all?

156
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,380
When my mind toys with such thoughts, I am
filled with inexpressible joy and tranquility.

157
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,150
No doubt about it...

158
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,720
It's him,
I'm sure of it...

159
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,000
Preposterous!
A curse, the very idea...

160
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,770
Monsieur Prosecutor, you suggest
that you do not sense...

161
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,970
...the gloomy, malevolent aura
that pervades this mansion?

162
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,970
That's CROWN Prosecutor.

163
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,870
Very well. I take it, then, that you must
see it with your own two eyes.

164
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,880
In truth, there is one room deep inside
this mansion that has been left exactly as it was.

165
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Why would you do that?

166
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,420
I am convinced that
it is that room...

167
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,560
...which is the source of the
malevolent aura here.

168
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,740
How rude!
We're leaving.

169
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,740
Monsieur!

170
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,450
Now, now, now, don't be
like that!

171
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,440
I for one say that we should indulge
our host's eccentricities.

172
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,450
What do you say, everyone? Why don't we
go see this "evil room" for ourselves?

173
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,890
Just a moment, please!

174
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,120
Going all at once would
spoil the entertainment.

175
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,590
Monsieur Albert!

176
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,400
Yes?

177
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,830
Monsieur Franz!

178
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,140
And Mademoiselle Eugenie.

179
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,760
Me?

180
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,100
I suggest that you split into three groups
to search for the room.

181
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,870
We shall have these three youths
lead the way.

182
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,780
I will offer a small gift to those
who successfully reach...

183
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,840
...the innermost depths
of this dark mansion.

184
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Are we agreed?

185
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,160
I like it!
This sounds like fun!

186
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,690
By all means,
let's do it!

187
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,890
Monsieur Albert, if you
would be so kind?

188
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,500
Yes, sir!

189
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,510
It's been a long time,
Marquise.

190
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,310
You're looking well.

191
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,480
Keep your mind
on the task at hand.

192
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,140
As they say, it's the early bird
that gets the worm.

193
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,810
Incidentally, Marquis Andrea,
where are you from?

194
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,190
Oh. Excuse me. I come from the
far reaches of the eastern galaxy.

195
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,890
There is a beautiful planetary
cluster there.

196
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,240
And on one of those planets
can be found a bird...

197
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,870
...which eats ore and lays
eggs of jewels.

198
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,570
Once every 50 years, they build a colony
for the purpose of mating, and...

199
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,410
We can finally speak
privately now.

200
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,150
Pardon me.

201
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,160
Count. I need to say
something to you.

202
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,510
Whatever is the matter,
Madame Morcerf?

203
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,820
Please, call me Mercedes.

204
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,910
This heart of the malevolent aura
that he mentioned...

205
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,760
What do you suppose
its heart really is?

206
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,930
Why are you so fixated
on Marseilles?

207
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,130
Whatever do you mean?

208
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,170
You served another dish from Marseilles
for dinner tonight.

209
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,580
Was it not to your liking?

210
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,480
No. It's just that when I look at you,
I am reminded of someone I once knew.

211
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,760
For many years, I have lived with
the desire to see him once again.

212
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,720
But now, I'm filled with
a terrible foreboding...

213
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,530
Count?

214
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,630
You are not alone. Never.

215
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,680
There is someone who
is always thinking of you.

216
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,880
Please don't forget that.

217
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,990
This is my good luck charm. It was
given to me by my late father.

218
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,030
I'd like you
to have it.

219
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,430
It's a dead end...

220
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,770
I've had enough of this, Albert.
Madame Danglars is tired, too.

221
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,100
We're turning back.

222
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,430
Monsieur Villefort!

223
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,370
There's a door inside!

224
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,400
T-This is...

225
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,530
Congratulations to you.

226
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,570
Your party is the first
to arrive.

227
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:01,610
Did you enjoy the unique ambiance
that this mansion has to offer?

228
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,010
I see that the master of this house doesn't
know the proper way to entertain guests!

229
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,620
Monsieur Albert, might I
ask for your assistance?

230
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,330
Yes, sir!

231
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,040
Thank you for playing along.
It must have been difficult.

232
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,840
I'm sorry, Count.

233
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,940
Sorry? Whatever for?

234
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:39,420
The truth is, I... I saw you.
In Madame Villefort's greenhouse.

235
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,450
Goodness, how awkward.
You saw us, did you?

236
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,950
Madame would not take no
for an answer, you see.

237
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,060
I simply assumed that you
were angry with me!

238
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,300
Perish the thought!

239
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,730
Incidentally, it is I who
should apologize to you.

240
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,340
I have been unable to speak
with you properly until today.

241
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,640
The fact of the matter is that I suffer from
an illness I contracted in distant space.

242
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,990
From time to time, I wish to
rest without seeing anyone.

243
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,430
That's...

244
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,930
It is nothing serious. I do feel a
numbness from time to time, however.

245
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:40,010
Albert. This is a secret
known only to you and me.

246
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,350
A secret between
you and me.

247
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,120
I understand.
I give you my word.

248
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,150
In that case, let us carry
this box through the door.

249
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,190
This is the room where
I gave birth to the child!

250
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,330
The child... The child has
summoned us here!

251
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,940
Pull yourself together!

252
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,570
But on that night
17 years ago...

253
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,810
Congratulations! This is our gift
from the Count!

254
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,710
NO!

255
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,780
Madame?

256
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,520
You...

257
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,320
Who the devil
are you?!

258
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,830
A poisonous evil stalks
the lovers.

259
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,290
But I am still unaware that I am about
to fall prey to it, as well.

260
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,670
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, Act 9:

261
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,220
Act 9:
I Dreamed a Dark Dream

262
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,240
..."I Dreamed
a Dark Dream."

263
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,570
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
