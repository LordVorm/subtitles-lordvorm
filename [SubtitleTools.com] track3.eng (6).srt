1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,000
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,840
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,680
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,350
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,060
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,900
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,740
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,780
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,910
Love me ever more

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,790
Love me ever more

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,380
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,340
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,100
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,360
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,990
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,660
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,070
When he steals into a mansion with a friend

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,750
...in order to help him win over his love,

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,910
...the young man witnesses a physical liaison between two adults.

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,950
My friend said to me, "He must know."

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,000
"Until the day his innocent soul is destroyed."

23
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Act 8:
A Night in Boulogne

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,130
This is bad...

25
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,930
Albert!

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
W-What are you barging in here for?!

27
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,070
I'm sorry. I kept calling, but you didn't answer.

28
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,350
You have a visitor from the Champs Elysees.

29
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,520
The Count?

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,190
His Excellency says that he does not wish to see you today.

31
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,220
Did he give you a message or something?

32
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,120
No, Monsieur, nothing in particular.

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,830
I see...

34
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,490
What's this?

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,890
His Excellency wishes to unveil his new villa.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,490
That is an invitation to a dinner party.
By all means, bring your entire family.

37
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,530
With pleasure!
Where is the villa?

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,470
The forest of Auteuil.

39
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,800
He has a villa in that gloomy place?

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,270
Yes. His Excellency insisted on this villa in particular.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,060
If I'm not mistaken, Monsieur Villefort used to own this villa.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,630
It's almost fallen to ruin.

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,230
While his first wife was still alive,
it was a bright, cheerful place.

44
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,110
You mean Valentine's real mother?

45
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,580
She was still so young and beautiful when she died.

46
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,170
Thank you for coming.

47
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,700
My lord General.

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,740
Thank you for inviting us.

49
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,480
Count!

50
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,010
Well, well! The good
Madame Villefort!

51
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,650
This is my husband, the...

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,860
The Crown Prosecutor,
I presume?

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm told that you did a great service for my wife and son.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,170
I am honored that you have gone to all the trouble of coming here.

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,670
This manor is a little too dreary to
invite guests over, don't you think?

56
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,970
Not at all, I have taken quite a liking to the silence here.

57
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,690
Now, I see that the three gentlemen who embody Paris are gathered here tonight.

58
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,480
Monsieur Danglars, the king of bankers.

59
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,620
General Morcerf, who commands the military.

60
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,720
And you, Monsieur, who administers the law.

61
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,930
There is a reason that I invited you here to this humble affair tonight.

62
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,440
Allow me to be frank and make a confession to you.

63
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,180
Travelers are insecure by their very nature.

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,480
I would like to forge bonds of friendship with you three gentlemen.

65
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,490
I am given to understand that you hope to win the presidency, General.

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,260
Where did you hear that?!

67
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,530
I would like to assist you to the best of my humble abilities.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,490
Albert. Leave us for a moment.

69
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,940
What? But l...

70
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,870
We adults need to have a discussion.

71
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,410
Albert, what's the matter?
You look a little out of it.

72
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,460
You don't look well.

73
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,930
No, I'm fine, Mother.

74
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,110
I'm sorry I forced you to come.

75
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,840
I wonder if the Count is avoiding me...

76
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,110
At Valentine's house,
I saw something.

77
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,560
I saw the Count and Madame Villefort being... intimate.

78
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,320
So?

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,300
While I was watching, the Count spotted me.

80
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,270
It seemed that way to me, anyway.

81
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,130
What about it?

82
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm a terrible person...

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,410
I guess the Count has a lot on his plate.

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,450
It just means that he's a man like any other.

85
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,190
Anyway, weren't you supposed to go there to work out the whole Maximilien situation?

86
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,720
That's the least of my worries right now.

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,990
Um...

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,190
Would it be all right if I joined you?

89
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,700
Who is this?

90
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,060
I'm going outside for some fresh air.

91
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,700
Um, might l...

92
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,310
What the hell did you do?

93
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,150
And who might you be, boy?

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,720
M-Me, sir? I am...

95
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,820
This is Captain Maximilien Morrel, a most capable soldier.

96
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,360
How do you do, sir?

97
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm Captain Maximilien Morrel,
Canes Venatici Gamma Army.

98
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,960
My family operates a trading
firm in Marseilles. As for me, l...

99
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,330
And what do you want?

100
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,770
Sir. I-I would like to ask for your daughter's hand in...

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,110
Yours is a noble profession, one which defends the state.

102
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,710
For that, I offer you my respects.

103
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,610
Nevertheless, you are a simple commoner.

104
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
And my daughter is already engaged.

105
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,420
I suggest that you bear those facts in mind.

106
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,690
How rude!

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,820
Bouillabaisse à la Marseilles.

108
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,570
So, how did the marriage proposal go?

109
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,540
Dead on arrival.

110
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,040
You know, maybe she really has feelings for you.

111
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,920
And what's this secret conversation about?

112
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,880
Beauchamp!

113
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,360
You've got guts, firing off a flash
at the Crown Prosecutor like that.

114
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,720
When I see a guy who's full of himself,
my rebellious streak takes over.

115
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,500
So, what's up?
The sorrows of youth?

116
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,970
Geez, what a sad world we're living in.
It's all "love" this and "affairs" that.

117
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,500
Look at that.

118
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,370
Rumor has it that those two were having an affair years ago, too.

119
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,910
The Crown Prosecutor and Eugenie's mother used to...

120
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,420
Forgive me for imposing on you.

121
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,510
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

122
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,150
I've paid a small fortune for her lessons. It's only fair that she should put it to good use at times like this.

123
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,300
Please listen to what
I have to say.

124
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,500
I'd like to apologize to you.

125
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,740
What I said the other day was terrible.
I didn't give any thought to your feelings.

126
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,720
What did Valentine say?

127
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,940
She was crying.

128
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
I guess I made you do my dirty work for me. I'm sorry.

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Valentine loves you.

130
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,300
You're kidding!

131
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,760
She does!

132
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,330
I'm sure of it.

133
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,370
Eugenie's gotten really good, hasn't she?

134
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,540
Hey, don't try to change the subject.

135
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,650
I talked to her the other day.

136
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,820
I bet she had a lot of bad things to say about me.

137
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,450
Pretty much.

138
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,850
What's that mean?
Tell me! C'mon, tell me!

139
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,300
What do you want from me after all this time?

140
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,570
I'm frightened.

141
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,430
What if someone sees us?

142
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,400
But when we're here, I can't help but think of our child!

143
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,860
Magnificent.

144
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,730
I see that music is truly your calling.

145
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,710
Her calling, huh? The Count must know a lot of talented people.

146
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,940
Thank you for the lovely performance, my lovely lady.

147
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,350
How do you do?

148
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,800
Now that one talented youth has made her debut, allow me to introduce another.

149
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,630
This is Marquis Andrea Cavalcanti.

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,900
Oh, my...

151
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,040
That family had an heir?

152
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,610
His father is an old friend of mine.

153
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,140
If you would welcome him as you have done me, nothing would make me happier.

154
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,750
I realize that I am an untested youth who only recently inherited his late father's estate, but I am honored to make your acquaintance.

155
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,730
Look at that brooch!
It easily cost five million!

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,190
Who's that guy?

157
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,870
The Count's new favorite, I'd say.

158
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,630
I bet he has all kinds of talents!

159
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,800
Well, ladies and gentlemen.

160
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,850
I do hate to interrupt your conversation, but if I might have your attention please?

161
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,580
One of the reasons that I purchased this estate...

162
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,550
...was that I wished to escape from the noise of the city and spend time in quiet contemplation.

163
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,620
But on the contrary, once I arrived here,

164
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,260
...I found myself fascinated by a certain aura that pervades this old mansion.

165
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,000
And what might that be?

166
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,970
How might one best describe it?

167
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,700
Yes... In a word...

168
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,090
...a curse.

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,350
I found myself pondering certain questions.

170
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,180
What sorts of lives were led by the people who once lived here?

171
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,820
And what sad events occured here that were hidden away from the eyes of all?

172
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:34,230
When my mind toys with such thoughts, I am filled with inexpressible joy and tranquility.

173
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,000
No doubt about it...

174
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,570
It's him,
I'm sure of it...

175
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,850
Preposterous!
A curse, the very idea...

176
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,620
Monsieur Prosecutor, you suggest that you do not sense...

177
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,820
...the gloomy, malevolent aura that pervades this mansion?

178
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,820
That's CROWN Prosecutor.

179
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,720
Very well. I take it, then, that you must
see it with your own two eyes.

180
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,730
In truth, there is one room deep inside
this mansion that has been left exactly as it was.

181
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,970
Why would you do that?

182
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,270
I am convinced that it is that room...

183
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,410
...which is the source of the malevolent aura here.

184
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,590
How rude!
We're leaving.

185
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,590
Monsieur!

186
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,300
Now, now, now, don't be like that!

187
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,290
I for one say that we should indulge our host's eccentricities.

188
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,300
What do you say, everyone? Why don't we go see this "evil room" for ourselves?

189
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,740
Just a moment, please!

190
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,970
Going all at once would spoil the entertainment.

191
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,440
Monsieur Albert!

192
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,250
Yes?

193
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,680
Monsieur Franz!

194
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,990
And Mademoiselle Eugenie.

195
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,610
Me?

196
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,950
I suggest that you split into three groups to search for the room.

197
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,720
We shall have these three youths lead the way.

198
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,630
I will offer a small gift to those who successfully reach...

199
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,690
...the innermost depths of this dark mansion.

200
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,170
Are we agreed?

201
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,010
I like it!
This sounds like fun!

202
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,540
By all means, let's do it!

203
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,740
Monsieur Albert, if you would be so kind?

204
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,350
Yes, sir!

205
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,360
It's been a long time,
Marquise.

206
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,160
You're looking well.

207
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
Keep your mind on the task at hand.

208
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,990
As they say, it's the early bird that gets the worm.

209
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,660
Incidentally, Marquis Andrea, where are you from?

210
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,040
Oh. Excuse me. I come from the far reaches of the eastern galaxy.

211
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,740
There is a beautiful planetary cluster there.

212
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,090
And on one of those planets can be found a bird...

213
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,720
...which eats ore and lays eggs of jewels.

214
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,420
Once every 50 years, they build a colony for the purpose of mating, and...

215
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,260
We can finally speak privately now.

216
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,000
Pardon me.

217
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,010
Count. I need to say something to you.

218
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
Whatever is the matter,
Madame Morcerf?

219
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,670
Please, call me Mercedes.

220
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,070
This heart of the malevolent aura that he mentioned...

221
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,610
What do you suppose its heart really is?

222
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,780
Why are you so fixated on Marseilles?

223
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,980
Whatever do you mean?

224
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,020
You served another dish from Marseilles for dinner tonight.

225
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,430
Was it not to your liking?

226
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,330
No. It's just that when I look at you,
I am reminded of someone I once knew.

227
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,610
For many years, I have lived with the desire to see him once again.

228
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,570
But now, I'm filled with a terrible foreboding...

229
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,380
Count?

230
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,480
You are not alone. Never.

231
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,530
There is someone who is always thinking of you.

232
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,730
Please don't forget that.

233
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,840
This is my good luck charm. It was given to me by my late father.

234
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,880
I'd like you to have it.

235
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,280
It's a dead end...

236
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,620
I've had enough of this, Albert.
Madame Danglars is tired, too.

237
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,950
We're turning back.

238
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,280
Monsieur Villefort!

239
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,220
There's a door inside!

240
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,250
T-This is...

241
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,380
Congratulations to you.

242
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,420
Your party is the first to arrive.

243
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,460
Did you enjoy the unique ambiance that this mansion has to offer?

244
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,860
I see that the master of this house doesn't know the proper way to entertain guests!

245
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,470
Monsieur Albert, might I ask for your assistance?

246
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,180
Yes, sir!

247
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,890
Thank you for playing along.
It must have been difficult.

248
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,690
I'm sorry, Count.

249
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,790
Sorry? Whatever for?

250
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:40,270
The truth is, I... I saw you.
In Madame Villefort's greenhouse.

251
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,300
Goodness, how awkward.
You saw us, did you?

252
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,800
Madame would not take no for an answer, you see.

253
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,910
I simply assumed that you were angry with me!

254
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,150
Perish the thought!

255
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,580
Incidentally, it is I who should apologize to you.

256
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,190
I have been unable to speak with you properly until today.

257
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,490
The fact of the matter is that I suffer from an illness I contracted in distant space.

258
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,840
From time to time, I wish to rest without seeing anyone.

259
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,280
That's...

260
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,780
It is nothing serious. I do feel a
numbness from time to time, however.

261
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,860
Albert. This is a secret known only to you and me.

262
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,200
A secret between you and me.

263
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,970
I understand.
I give you my word.

264
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,000
In that case, let us carry this box through the door.

265
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,040
This is the room where
I gave birth to the child!

266
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,180
The child... The child has summoned us here!

267
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,790
Pull yourself together!

268
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,420
But on that night
17 years ago...

269
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,660
Congratulations! This is our gift from the Count!

270
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,560
NO!

271
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,630
Madame?

272
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,370
You...

273
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,170
Who the devil are you?!

274
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm not the man I used to be

275
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:09,410
And what you see is not what it seems

276
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:16,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

277
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

278
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,850
You won't see me coming...

279
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,360
You won't see me coming...

280
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,360
Till I strike

281
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,250
You won't see me coming...

282
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,760
You won't see me coming...

283
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,890
Till I strike

284
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,680
A poisonous evil stalks the lovers.

285
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,140
But I am still unaware that I am about to fall prey to it, as well.

286
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,520
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 9:

287
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,210
Act 9:
I Dreamed a Dark Dream

288
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,090
..."I Dreamed a Dark Dream".

289
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,420
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
