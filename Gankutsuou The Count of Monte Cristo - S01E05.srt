1
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

2
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,320
When he learned something
of his mother's past,

3
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,490
...the young man saw in her profile
the figure of a woman.

4
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,130
However, he is
still unaware.

5
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
Still unaware of the true identity of the man
who brought this look to her face.

6
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,100
Act 5:
Do You Love Your FiancÃ©e?

7
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,340
I can't believe I'm seeing sights like this
underneath the Champs Elysees.

8
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,150
It's like a dream.

9
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,980
Perhaps this truly is
but a dream.

10
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,450
At times, I find myself forced
to consider that possibility.

11
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,490
In that case, here's an eye-opening question
for you. How much did you sink into this?

12
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,700
How much did this dream house
of yours set you back?

13
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,800
We stopped bothering with hassles
like keeping track of the money...

14
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,930
...halfway through construction.

15
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,700
Thanks for that reply.
It'll make a great headline.

16
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,640
Where's that music
coming from?

17
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,320
There!

18
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,930
She's the girl from
the opera!

19
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,100
She's beautiful...

20
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,730
You're not gonna try and tell us
that she's artificial, too, are you?

21
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,800
Don't be rude!
She's...

22
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,840
She is a doll
named Haidee.

23
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,380
A poor puppet who still lives, even
after her soul has been stolen away.

24
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,080
Haidee obeys
my every whim,

25
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,680
...and should I wish it, would not
hesitate to take her own life.

26
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,150
You're kidding...

27
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,220
Don't be so surprised. This is the Count
of Monte Cristo we're talking about.

28
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,420
He renounced his soul
ages ago.

29
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,890
Am I wrong?

30
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,000
You're going too far,
Beauchamp!

31
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
How else could a man amass a fortune
like this in one lifetime?

32
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,770
I'm afraid... I must agree.

33
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,940
Why are you all
acting like this?

34
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,180
Listen, the Count isn't as cold
a man as you think he is.

35
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,740
Isn't that right,
Count?

36
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,910
I would not know.
I cannot see myself.

37
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,900
Welcome to our home.
I am Haidee.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
H-Hello.

39
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,140
Who's that?

40
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,380
He is Ali. Like Haidee, he is
a noble doll that I own.

41
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,450
Haidee, the Viscount
seems perplexed...

42
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,190
...as to what
you are to me.

43
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,280
I am but a humble twig
that allows the Count to bloom.

44
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,300
A graceful girl like her is the twig,
and the Count is the flower, huh?

45
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,500
Are you happy
like this?

46
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,140
I know the joy of making
the flowers bloom.

47
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,480
But...

48
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,520
Does my harp's music
sound gloomy?

49
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,040
No.

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,680
The notes of a harp
are the notes of the heart.

51
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,180
The strings don't respond
to a hesitant, timid heart,

52
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,460
...and a tense heart will cause
the strings to break.

53
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,570
Being with the Count
makes me happy.

54
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,070
I assumed that you and the Count
were in love with one another...

55
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,330
In love with each other, huh?
Could you be any more naive?

56
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,280
What's that supposed
to mean?

57
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,710
Think about it.

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,570
Marriage among aristocrats is just a strategic
alliance with the goal of cementing fortunes.

59
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,420
In point of fact, that's why Franz
and Valentine are engaged, right?

60
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,920
Is that true?!

61
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,060
Well, I won't deny it...

62
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Right, Albert? Isn't it the same
with you and Eugenie?

63
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,430
Well, I guess...

64
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,300
In other words, love is something that
doesn't exist in the privileged class.

65
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,710
How can this be...

66
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,020
What's the matter,
Maximilien?

67
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,600
Is what I said too hard
to swallow?

68
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,470
No.

69
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,560
Even so, everything I said
was the truth.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,960
The only thing that's important to them is
keeping their family fortune from shrinking.

71
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,340
In other words, you two aren't the product of
love, you're the product of financial interests.

72
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,710
I wouldn't be so sure.

73
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,610
For my parents at least, they say that
their marriage was out of love.

74
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,120
I find that hard to believe. A notorious
player like General Morcerf?

75
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,280
Are you trying to
insult my father?!

76
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,620
Seeing you get so mad about it
makes it seem even more dubious.

77
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Is there something about your parents
that you're feeling guilty about?

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,890
Of course not.

79
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,060
Why would I feel guilty
about anything?

80
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,600
Hey, Beauchamp.

81
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,800
I don't care if you think you're a journalist.
You should drop this subject.

82
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,510
Hey, what's this? You're clamping
down on freedom of speech now?

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,570
"How wretched it all is..."
Is that not what you are thinking,

84
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,820
...my good
Captain Morrel?

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,280
To think that loveless marriages
are allowed to go unquestioned...

86
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,200
Is something wrong,
Maximilien?

87
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,600
The people of Paris
are corrupt!

88
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,770
Maximilien, you're going too far!!
I demand that you take that back!

89
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,300
I can't do that.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,010
Paris has more than its fair share of honest,
upright people! Take back what you said!

91
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,710
I can't do that.

92
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,450
Take it back!

93
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,580
I can't.

94
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,900
Stop it, Albert!

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,720
Hey, now...

96
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,990
Stop it.

97
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,260
Viscount Morcerf.

98
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,500
Do you realize what you
are pointing at me?

99
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,840
I must warn you,
I am a soldier.

100
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,320
This will not do.

101
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,280
It is unseemly for one party to draw
his sword while the other does not.

102
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,820
Count?

103
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,260
It appears to me that each of you
is steadfast in your opinion.

104
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,090
As we are at sea, perhaps we pirates
should act the part...

105
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,490
...and have a duel?

106
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,860
A duel?

107
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,530
On the sea, strength counts
for everything.

108
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,670
He with the better sword arm
makes the rules.

109
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,210
Are you serious?

110
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,140
What are you suggesting, Count?!

111
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,280
Come, now is the time to
demonstrate your conviction.

112
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,420
Prove to them that you hold your
parents' marriage to be sacred.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,190
The blade in your hand
is invincible.

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
And you, Monsieur?

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,400
All men have a blade
in their heart.

116
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,100
The purer the heart,
the keener the blade.

117
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,710
The time is high tide, the place is the ship's
bow, and the weapons are bare blades!

118
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
Come on, gentlemen!

119
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,760
Let's see you go at it,
pirate style!

120
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,330
It's hard to believe that there are still people in
this day and age who'd fight a duel over love...

121
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,000
Is this any time to be joking?!
Those swords are real!

122
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,230
And the water down there is teeming with
sharks that are thirsting for human blood!

123
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,240
Count, what are you
trying to do?!

124
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,110
Sea voyages are accompanied
by their own entertainment.

125
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,980
I expect that Monsieur Albert is
thirsting for stimulation of this sort.

126
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,220
Let's do it!

127
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,850
Whenever you're ready.

128
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,190
Take back
what you said!

129
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,890
I can't!

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,970
Why, you...!

131
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,330
How about now?!

132
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,000
You poor, sad people...

133
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,450
The purer the heart,
the keener the blade.

134
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,050
You aren't capable
of defeating me.

135
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,750
Shut up!

136
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,120
Understand this.

137
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,030
No matter what you say, no matter
how it is with other families,

138
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,340
...my parents' marriage
is a sacred bond!

139
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,100
I didn't expect you to turn
towards your unarmed side.

140
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,340
I admire your agility.

141
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,040
Nevertheless, the insincere will be
smitten by righteous anger!

142
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,720
I won't stand for it!
I won't!

143
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,820
What in the world's gotten
into Maximilien?

144
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,330
I guess he's the
scrupulous type.

145
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,460
You're finished!

146
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,100
Why do you have such disdain
for the aristocracy?!

147
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,730
That's none of
your concern!

148
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,970
The hell it isn't!
Tell me why!

149
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,130
In that case, there's something
I want to ask you, too!

150
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,640
Is it true that you don't
love your fiancÃ©e?

151
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,910
Well, l...

152
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,480
I demand an answer!

153
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,980
I don't know!

154
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,720
As I thought, I can't
abide by this!

155
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,800
You have lost, Monsieur.

156
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,750
Hey, hold it!

157
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,550
Albert!

158
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,130
- Albert!
- Don't!

159
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,760
There are sharks
down there!

160
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,170
This is a nightmare...

161
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,760
Indeed it is.

162
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,800
This is a dream.

163
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,970
All is but a waking dream.

164
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,890
Albert...

165
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,060
Mother...

166
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,430
I did it because you had that
look on your face, Mother...

167
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,810
Count...

168
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,210
One cannot fight destiny.

169
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,940
I'm ashamed of myself.
I can't believe how angry I got.

170
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,320
I can see it clearly.

171
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,390
Within your heart, another side
of yourself lies dormant.

172
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,360
At the moment, you are burdened with
a profound sense of apprehension.

173
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,160
As am I.

174
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,500
You are, Count?

175
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,740
I have need of you.

176
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,970
Who, me?

177
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,100
You and I met
that day on Luna.

178
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,520
Perhaps you feel that our meeting
was a chance encounter.

179
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,260
But in fate, there are
no coincidences.

180
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,650
Just as that setting sun does so
according to the laws of the universe,

181
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,390
...fate, too, is composed
of unyielding necessity.

182
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,000
What are you apprehensive
about, Count?

183
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,780
It is because a man loves
that he laughs, cries, and hates.

184
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,250
Count, what are you saying?

185
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,080
My life is much like
this miniature garden.

186
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,260
It is a hollow,
fragile thing.

187
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:31,010
C'mon, Albert, cheer up already.
Maximilien already apologized, didn't he?

188
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,550
I'm not mad.

189
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,740
Then why...

190
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,030
Don't hang around
the Count anymore.

191
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,600
You've been acting
funny lately.

192
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,490
You're right.
I guess I have.

193
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,500
Something's funny.
Something about all this.

194
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,910
Up until yesterday, life was one
uneventful day after another.

195
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,010
It almost feels like something hidden
is at work behind all this.

196
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,390
Destiny... Have you ever thought
about fate and stuff like that?

197
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,390
No. I don't believe
in that stuff.

198
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,130
How did your mother
and I meet?

199
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,770
Why the sudden interest?

200
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,430
Please, I'd like to know.

201
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,930
As I've told you before, your mother and I
were married after a storybook courtship.

202
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,170
Yes, it was just as your father says.
We were lovers.

203
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,620
I've never seen that look
on Mother's face before.

204
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,120
You look like you're delirious
with a fever, young master.

205
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,900
Why don't you go out
for some fresh air?

206
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,130
Make sure you
clean in here!

207
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,610
Yes, sir!

208
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,790
Mother, who are you thinking
about right now?

209
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,340
How far will the ship sail,
I wonder?

210
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,580
There is no
turning back now.

211
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,840
I see... You hope to expand your business
ventures to include Paris, as well?

212
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,370
I can think of no stronger backer to
have than yourself, General Morcerf.

213
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,480
You do me a great honor,
Monte Cristo.

214
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,750
I take it that you already
have a plan of action.

215
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,850
Please feel free to call on me
should you have any need at all.

216
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,700
He seems to be
quite powerful.

217
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,330
The crest of the Danglars family can
be seen here and there around town.

218
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,380
He has no idea that the Count
is keeping a close eye on him.

219
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,340
Talk about conceited.

220
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,350
Waving a sword around
in anger like that...

221
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,720
You really are hopeless,
you know that?

222
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,360
Tell me, what kind of relationship
do you and I have?

223
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,060
What brought this on?

224
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,360
Something that
Maximilien said.

225
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,760
"Is it true that you don't
love your fiancÃ©e?"

226
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,270
Oh.

227
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,680
Do you, Albert?

228
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,150
You and I... are childhood
friends, right?

229
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,220
You and Franz
have changed.

230
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,150
In the old days, the three of us
would always have fun together.

231
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,560
But now, the two of you sneak off
on trips by yourselves...

232
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,830
Everybody is changing.

233
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,840
Do you know why Maximilien
was so angry?

234
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,940
You honestly don't know?

235
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,010
Well, if you say so.

236
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,640
What's that supposed
to mean?!

237
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,780
I guess no one can do anything
to stop it...

238
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,210
...when two people have feelings
for each other.

239
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,420
I didn't mean to keep
you waiting, Eugenie.

240
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,430
I'm sorry. It took a long time
to get ready.

241
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,820
That's all right.

242
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, my. Albert, is something the matter?
You look so grim.

243
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
Stay safe.

244
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,810
Hey! Albert!

245
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,140
Albert!

246
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
She and her father.
And her mother.

247
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,180
The specter of uncertainty sneaks up on
them through their conflicting emotions.

248
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,990
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, Act 6:

249
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,720
Act 6:
Her Melancholy, My Melancholy

250
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,260
..."Her Melancholy,
My Melancholy."

251
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,760
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
