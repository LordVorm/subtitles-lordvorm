1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,490
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,950
My friend invited three families to his villa,

20
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,530
...where a forbidden past lay dormant.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,030
When that soul which had been interred there returned to life,

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,080
...I sensed clearly

23
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,700
...that a new vengeance was about to sprout.

24
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,560
Act 9:
I Dreamed A Dark Dream

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,930
Somebody!

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,300
Somebody, send for a doctor!

27
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,440
What's the matter?

28
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,720
It's Madame Danglars!

29
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,960
She's collapsed!

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,140
What the hell are you after?!

31
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,950
What's your game?!

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,620
Surely you jest. My only goal is to
have my guests enjoy the party.

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,960
You've gone too far! This manor was originally owned by my father-in-law.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,130
If you're deliberately trying to insult me,
I'll make you regret it!

35
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,580
Even though I was unaware of that fact,
I have indeed been most rude.

36
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,710
Still, this is a most fascinating,

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,690
...not to mention most odd, coincidence.

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,830
Which means, then, that this place is as familiar to you as the back of your hand.

39
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,370
In which case, my little entertainment was unfair from the very beginning.

40
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,370
This simply won't do.
Shall we start over and try it again?

41
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,380
What in the world happened, Albert?

42
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,350
I'm not really sure.

43
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,220
As part of the game, I was about to give
Madame Victoria the box with the prize in it,

44
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,990
...and the instant I did, she...

45
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,670
What in the world made her faint?

46
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,410
H-How can this be?

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,540
Dear boy, forgive me...

48
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,110
It seems to be a case of anemia.
It is nothing serious.

49
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll ask you again.
Who ARE you?

50
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,990
Exactly what do you know?

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,060
Your life depends on your answer.

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,290
Answer me!

53
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,360
I am but a poor bumpkin who has come from the far reaches of Eastern Space.

54
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,540
Other than that, I have no past which is worth speaking of.

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
None at all.

56
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,020
Victoria!

57
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,820
Victoria! What's happened to her?!

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,220
You needn't worry.
She is merely feeling out of sorts.

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,590
Hey! Honey! Hey!

60
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,660
I expect that a few moments' rest will have her feeling good as new.

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Is that not right?

62
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,980
Where's Eugenie?

63
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,570
Let's look for her!

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
Eugenie!

65
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,210
Eugenie!
Where are you?!

66
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,720
Father! Eugenie!

67
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,360
You there!

68
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,330
Do you know where Eugenie is?
She's Monsieur Danglars' daughter.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,040
I've heard stories about you from the Count.

70
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,270
All sorts of things.

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,200
So, you're Albert, son of the Morcerf family...

72
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,080
Where's Eugenie?
Isn't she with you?!

73
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,090
She's already headed towards the inner chambers, both she and your father.

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,230
Let me make one thing perfectly clear to you.

75
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:13,030
In all the world, I am the only person capable of understanding the Count's feelings.

76
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,540
Wha...?

77
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,840
Now, if you'll excuse me.

78
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,890
Count!

79
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,990
Give me your hand, sir.

80
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,490
My thanks, Bertuccio...

81
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,100
What are those markings...?

82
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,630
I'd ask you not to overexert yourself, but I'd probably be wasting my breath.

83
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,730
Do you have it in you to follow me?
Into the darkest depths of Hell?

84
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,780
Of course. I'll be at your side wherever you go, Gankutsuou.

85
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,960
Gankutsuou?

86
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,160
Mother...

87
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,830
I'm all right.
I'm fine now.

88
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,670
I'm sorry if I worried you.

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,190
Valentine!

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,030
Albert!

91
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,610
I'm sorry about earlier. I got carried away without stopping to consider your feelings.

92
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,910
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
I said such rude things.

93
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,410
Still, I'm glad. It's nice that you two can have a normal conversation now.

94
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,450
I... had misjudged him.

95
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,990
I'm glad we had this chance to talk.

96
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,960
As am I!

97
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,470
Now that all the excitement's over,
I feel kinda...

98
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,540
Albert?

99
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,510
Monsieur Albert?

100
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,640
Hold on!

101
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,950
Monsieur Albert!

102
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,690
Monsieur Albert!

103
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,070
How are you feeling?

104
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
It feels like a weight on my chest has been lifted.

105
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,230
I am glad to hear it.
I mixed this medicine especially for you.

106
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Nothing is better for the treatment of chest pains.

107
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,150
I'm sorry if I made any trouble for you.

108
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,550
For some reason, I felt sick all of a sudden...

109
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,590
What could be wrong with Albert?

110
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,790
Ever since we were kids,
he's never had so much as a cold.

111
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,920
You and Albert are childhood friends, aren't you?

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,460
Yeah.

113
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,930
I heard all about it from
Mademoiselle Valentine.

114
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,710
She said that she has always been jealous of how close you two are.

115
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,340
It's just because we've known each other for so long.

116
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,440
It's not just because you're old friends, is it?

117
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,850
I somehow get the impression that you two share a bond that no one else can share in.

118
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,530
Speaking of which, how long have you had feelings for Valentine?

119
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,360
That's an awkward question to be asked by her fiancée.

120
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,160
Of course, you're right.
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,440
No, I am the one who is at fault here.

122
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,370
But if you love her, that should be all that matters.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,650
There you go, saying such irresponsible things again...

124
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,350
Irresponsible, huh?
I suppose it is.

125
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,890
It's a strange thing.

126
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,230
Why can't you love Mademoiselle Valentine?
She is your fiancée, after all.

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,370
What about you? Will you stop loving her just because you can't marry her?

128
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,730
As to that...

129
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,740
You can't, can you? You can't simply fall out of love, can you?

130
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,510
Even if it's a relationship where you can't marry the person.

131
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,750
Are you saying that you harbor a hopeless love for someone, too?

132
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,260
Marriage isn't necessarily the only way to make that person happy.

133
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,250
Don't you think?

134
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,860
I hadn't thought of that...
Perhaps you're right.

135
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
Valentine's found herself a great guy.

136
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,950
Albert.

137
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,250
Sir?

138
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,340
I realize that this is an odd question, but what have you eaten today?

139
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,690
Actually, I've been so busy today that I haven't eaten anything at all.

140
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,190
But now that you mention it, I drank some water from the table with the blue flowers.

141
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,060
The table with blue flowers was the Villefort family's table.

142
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,600
Do you think that has anything to do with it?

143
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,430
Albert, I would like you to remain calm and listen to me.

144
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,540
What had been attacking your body... was poison.

145
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,280
Poison?

146
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,180
Yes, a fearful poison that is called
"zhen-du" in Eastern Space.

147
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,350
You're saying that the water was poisoned?

148
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,460
It would be safe to assume so.

149
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,830
You managed to survive because the ice had melted, thus diluting the poison,

150
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,190
...but you nevertheless had a close call.

151
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,670
Who would do such a thing?

152
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,500
I suspect that you were not the target.

153
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,700
Right. The poison was mixed into that water pitcher,

154
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,700
...so that means the target was the Villefort family.

155
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,750
But why?

156
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,420
Feelings of hatred and jealousy towards another...

157
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,560
...are emotions which silently fester and grow, unbeknownst to the object of their affection.

158
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,020
The happier that person is, the less aware he is of their feelings.

159
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:27,290
However, their attempt ended in failure. Which means that they will lay another trap to...

160
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,470
They can't! There are people that I want to be happy!

161
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,840
Albert, are you sure you should be out of bed?

162
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,310
I feel fine now.
Sorry I made you worry.

163
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,380
Still, I think you should take it easy.

164
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,490
He's right,
Monsieur Albert.

165
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,250
No, we have to hurry.

166
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,360
I'll explain later. Anyway, we have to get to Valentine's house.

167
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,330
To Mademoiselle
Valentine's house?

168
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,780
Yeah.

169
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,170
You're such a frightening man...

170
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,440
And at the same time, so very alluring...

171
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,730
Are we clear on this,
Boville?

172
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,540
Use every network at your disposal and find out everything there is to know about that man.

173
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,240
Focus your investigation on Marseilles in particular.

174
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,810
Understood.

175
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,110
"Count of Monte Cristo", my ass. Mark my words, I'll find out who you really are.

176
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,130
Incidentally, what is your connection to this man, Your Honor?

177
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,130
That isn't something that you need to concern yourself about.

178
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,060
Yes, sir. But I suggest that you be mindful of rats.

179
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,170
Yes, I know.

180
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,570
I'll be off, then.

181
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,450
Look, Grandfather.
Isn't this a beautiful rosary?

182
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,300
Pardon me.

183
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,470
I've brought you something to drink.

184
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,740
Thank you, Valois.

185
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,300
Still, don't you think the Count is reading too much into this? I mean, come on, someone's trying to kill the Villefort family?

186
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,030
He's not like other people.
I believe him.

187
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,070
Say, Franz...
Will you hear me out?

188
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,080
What's up? You sound awfully serious.

189
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,680
The thing is, I finally figured something out.

190
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,350
Well? What is it?

191
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,880
You might laugh at me for saying this, Franz,

192
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,390
...but I really do think it's important for the two people to love each other.

193
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,830
What's gotten into you?
What brought this on?

194
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:46,590
Well, I... It's just that I want Valentine and Maximilien to be happy.

195
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,140
I know it's more complicated than that for you, though.

196
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,800
Not at all. I want the same thing with all my heart.

197
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,280
If it's humanly possible, I think two people who love each other should be together.

198
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,610
You do, huh?

199
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,980
The love those two have is the real thing.
I want them to be happy.

200
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,950
No way am I gonna let anybody poison her!

201
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,390
The rain has certainly gotten stronger...

202
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,330
It's rather humid, isn't it?

203
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,470
You must be hot, Valois.
Would you like a glass, too?

204
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,040
Eh? No, I couldn't possibly,
Mademoiselle.

205
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,210
It's all right, don't stand on ceremony.

206
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,720
Valois!

207
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,260
Valois, what's the matter?
Valois!

208
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,030
M-Mademoiselle...

209
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,400
Valois?

210
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,830
Valois!

211
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,340
W-What happened?

212
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,140
Grandfather...

213
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,680
Hurry!

214
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,350
Hurry, call the doctor!

215
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,190
Mademoiselle Valentine!

216
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,620
How can this be?
Mademoiselle Valentine!

217
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,370
I can't believe it.
It's just like the Count said.

218
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,340
What the hell is going on?

219
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,980
I'll be back.

220
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,410
Where are you going?

221
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,140
Where else?
To go see the Count.

222
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,680
He might be able to do something for her.

223
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
Hey, Albert!

224
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,920
Albert...

225
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,530
I'll be at your side wherever you go, Gankutsuou.

226
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,770
I'm sorry, but His Excellency is away on a business trip at the moment.

227
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,580
You're kidding!
When will he be back?

228
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,090
That is entirely up to His Excellency.
I'm sorry I cannot be of more help.

229
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,390
I see that you're helpless by yourself, same as always.

230
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,660
You!

231
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out.

232
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,370
What's that supposed to mean?

233
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,300
Do you have the courage to learn what the future holds?

234
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,240
Who the hell you?

235
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,430
Damn it!
What am I gonna do?

236
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,340
Don't die, Valentine!

237
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,550
You child of illicit love who has awoken from a dark dream...

238
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,730
...and come back to life from the depths of death...

239
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:11,230
You beautiful child who knows nothing of love, nor of being loved.

240
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,770
Thou art anathema.

241
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,880
Thou art anathema!

242
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

243
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

244
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

245
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

246
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

247
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

248
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

249
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

250
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

251
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

252
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,160
A dark cloud spreads out like a stain to cover our lives.

253
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,120
And a letter arrives from an old friend
who was thought to be dead.

254
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,360
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 10:

255
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,830
Act 10:
The Letter From Edmond

256
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,700
..."The Letter
From Edmond".

257
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,000
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
