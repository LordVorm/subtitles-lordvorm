1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,900
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,580
The life of the young boy that was sacrificed to my friend...

20
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,700
...was cradled in the pure soul's arms as it faded away.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,990
And I rejoiced.

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,960
His soul has at long last been tainted.

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,500
Tainted by the fires of a remorse and hatred which will never fade.

24
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,180
Why, Franz?

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,320
You promised me that you wouldn't go away anymore without telling me, didn't you?

26
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,490
Franz... I couldn't bring myself to go to your funeral no matter how hard I tried.

27
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,710
How could I? Right up until yesterday, you were by my side.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,110
You were always there for me when I needed you.

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,950
But now, all I have is this letter...

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,050
Why did it have to be you?
Why was it you instead of me?!

31
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,190
C'mon, Franz, answer me...
Just like you always do.

32
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,760
Say something...
Say anything, Franz...

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,620
Act 19:
Even if I Should Stop Being Me

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,450
Queen to F3.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,150
Pawn, C7 to C6.

36
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,660
Danglars Bank stocks have posted trading limit highs for several days now.

37
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,400
Knight to E4.

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,910
Queen, B6 to C7.

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,100
Every stock in his investment portfolio is on an explosive growth trend.

40
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,400
That Andrea kid did his job a lot better than I expected.

41
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,740
Very well. We will start flooding his investments with sell-offs.

42
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,810
The Paris market goes without saying, but the Eastern, Kingdom, and Frontier markets, as well.

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,980
Keep flooding all of them with sell-offs in succession until each market closes.

44
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,280
Understood.

45
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,120
Pawn to C4.

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,100
By the way, Excellency...

47
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,070
Knight, D5 to E7.

48
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,070
Haidee wishes to speak with you.

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,670
Count, I love you more than I did my father.

50
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,770
I cannot bear to see you change any further.

51
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,690
Please, continuing to do this would be...

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,690
Knight, E4 to G5.

53
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,900
Unnecessary pawns are to be sacrificed without mercy!

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,720
Knight to C8.

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,980
Everything that stands between me and my revenge! Without mercy!

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,640
Bertuccio!
Take Haidee away!

57
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,750
Very good, Excellency.

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,820
Count! Did you only save me so that you could use me as a tool for revenge?

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,400
You are not that sort of man!

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,870
Count, I have faith in you!
Count!

61
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,600
Count!

62
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,130
Pawn to C5.

63
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,530
The game is yours.

64
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,670
The end is almost upon us...

65
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,710
Just take a look at today's stock prices, Andrea!

66
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,420
I can't wipe the smile from my face!

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm glad to hear it.

68
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,580
I owe my success to you.
I'm in your debt.

69
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,990
Not at all.

70
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,130
More importantly, about the wedding ceremony...

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,760
She's being stubborn.

72
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,210
Something about a friend dying suddenly, so she can't get married anytime soon.

73
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,910
Honestly, I have no idea where that girl gets her stubborn streak from.

74
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,090
If that's the case, it's quite understandable.

75
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,890
That reminds me, how is her mother doing? She's been bedridden for quite some time. Perhaps if I went and offered her my best...

76
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,290
Of course! If you were to keep her company,
I'm sure it would take her mind off things!

77
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,790
I certainly hope that you are right.

78
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,520
How much longer will our bank's assets continue to multiply like this? Right, Michelle?

79
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,900
Indeed.

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,070
Open the display!

81
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,770
Every last one of my stocks is humming along smoothly.

82
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,220
Albert.

83
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,930
Albert, listen to me.
I'm thinking of leaving Paris.

84
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,360
Come with me to my home town.

85
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,440
Admittedly, life there won't be as extravagant as we're used to here.

86
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,670
If it's just the two of us, I have enough saved away to at least keep us fed.

87
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,780
What about Father?

88
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,810
You're a real opportunist, aren't you, Mother?

89
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,410
Albert!

90
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,390
I've had all I can take!

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,420
When you get right down to it, it's you and your old friends' fault that this happened.

92
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,260
I got caught in the middle of you and your old lovers' sick love triangle.

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,730
Who gives a damn about
Edmond Dantes?!

94
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,940
Why are my friends and l...
Why did Franz, of all people, have to die?!

95
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,640
Albert, where are you going?

96
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,940
Beats me.
Nowhere in particular.

97
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,650
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

98
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,040
Everybody would be better off if I had died.

99
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,420
If you want to blame me for what happened, go ahead and blame me for the rest of your life.

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,100
But you shouldn't... You shouldn't think so little of yourself.

101
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,320
Permit, please.

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,490
I don't have one. They always let me pass through.

103
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,130
You know, you really shouldn't go around thinking you're still an aristocrat.

104
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,990
Your ID number's already been revoked.
You can't come and go as you please anymore.

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,500
What's going on here?!

106
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,300
What it looks like.

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,930
Like they say, a stupid father is gonna have nothing but stupid kids.

108
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,540
Go get yourself a permit.

109
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,410
That's assuming that they'll even give you one.

110
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
Good point.

111
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,050
You punk!

112
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,530
You fraudulent piece of crap!

113
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,710
Stop that! Get off my bike!
Get your hands off it!

114
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,200
Hey!

115
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,310
You're fighting ME, remember?!

116
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,910
Don't think that you can still boss us around! Got it?!

117
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,290
This state is most unbecoming a beautiful lady such as yourself.

118
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,470
It doesn't matter.
I'm always alone.

119
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't say such things.

120
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,410
Seeing you sad simply tears my heart in two.

121
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,150
Men always say things like that to try to make me feel better.

122
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,490
I will always be by your side.
Mother.

123
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,220
Andrea...

124
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,190
Please, just for today... Just for now...
Call me Victoria.

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,470
Victoria, then.

126
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,680
Punk!

127
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,500
Are you okay, Albert?

128
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,170
Franz?
Franz, is that you?!

129
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,940
What's gotten into you?
Are you okay?

130
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,280
Franz!

131
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,910
Hey, cut it out!

132
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
Thank goodness!

133
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm so glad you're all right...

134
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,650
Is this any time for you to be worrying about someone else?

135
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,560
C'mon, let's go home.

136
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,700
Albert! Happy birthday!

137
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,670
Congratulations,
Monsieur Albert.

138
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,070
Congratulations.
What kept you?

139
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,430
What have you been up to?
She's been waiting for you for ages!

140
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,670
Who do you mean?

141
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,880
Eugenie!

142
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,550
Albert, congratulations on turning sixteen.

143
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,030
They're going at it in broad daylight!

144
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,290
Save that stuff for when you're in private, will ya?!

145
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,630
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the man without whom this party would not be complete!

146
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,540
The man who saved Albert's life on Luna, the Count of Monte Cristo!

147
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,970
Franz, we can't! We can't invite this man to Paris!

148
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,080
Why not? We both insisted that he come visit, remember?

149
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,020
Look. Everybody says that they're dying to meet the Count.

150
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,560
You can't! He's a demon who's come back to Paris to get revenge on us all!

151
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,800
Darling, why don't you introduce yourself first?

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,600
Father! Mother! Run!

153
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,060
Eugenie and Franz! You, too! Hurry!

154
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm feeling a little shy.

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,700
Hurry! Get as far away from him as you can!

156
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,500
Count!

157
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,240
Thank you for your kind invitation.

158
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,910
Don't do it!

159
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,280
Don't do it, Franz!
He's the man who killed you!

160
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,940
"My, how fascinating."

161
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,390
Please, I'm begging you...

162
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
This is for Franz!

163
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,250
Um, Albert?

164
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,420
You were the one who killed me.

165
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,160
Albert, when you think about it, it was you who killed me, right?

166
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,370
It was you.

167
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,700
No!

168
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,360
I wanted to save you!

169
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,510
You only think of yourself, and you know it.

170
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,780
Every time I tried to tell you something, you never listened.

171
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,170
No! Franz, it wasn't like that!

172
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,050
I'll hate you. I'll hate you for as long as I live.

173
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,260
Ow... It hurts...

174
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,520
It hurts...

175
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,670
Franz!

176
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,130
Franz!

177
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,630
It hurts...

178
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,870
Franz!

179
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,630
Franz, I'm sorry!
Franz!

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,770
Franz?

181
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,240
No, Franz!
Don't die!

182
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,900
Please don't die!

183
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,540
There's something that
I have to tell you!

184
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,180
So don't leave me!

185
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,710
No! Franz, don't die!

186
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,920
Franz!

187
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,650
FRANZ!

188
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,900
Hey, Albert, are you okay?
Snap out of it!

189
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,960
Hey! Albert!

190
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Hey!

191
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,970
Franz!

192
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,990
I guess there's nothing to worry about if you can still move like that.

193
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,940
Renaud?

194
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,210
Where am I?

195
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,540
By coincidence, I spotted a guy riding your bike.

196
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,510
Relax, your bike is safe.
The evildoers have been punished!

197
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,680
Sorry about that.

198
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,990
What're you talking about? Everybody needs a tool-loving, bike-loving friend, you know?

199
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,360
Admittedly, I pushed her so hard to get here that she's in pretty bad shape now.

200
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,760
Do you have any idea how badly
I've been waiting for today to arrive?!

201
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,170
I looked everywhere for rare parts, endured setback after setback, and finally got her in working order!

202
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,240
Chest swelled with anticipation, I set out in high spirits for a long drive, and what happens?

203
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,240
"Hm? Why, that's Albert's bike!
But who's that on it?!"

204
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,440
So I pull up to him, planning to ask him what's going on, and...

205
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,820
Gimme that ratchet.

206
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,020
Here.

207
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,520
My baby's showing signs of a recovery!

208
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,010
Aren't you being overly dramatic?

209
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,300
"Overly dramatic", nothing! There's no sadder sight than a machine that can't be fixed!

210
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,230
I had the same problem that night we rescued Valentine. That was so terrible...

211
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,970
That was YOUR car?

212
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,080
It sure was... You have no idea how bad my heart was broken that day.

213
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,360
How can you talk like that?
Valentine was about to die!

214
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't get me wrong! I volunteered my car because they said they were gonna go rescue Valentine.

215
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,090
The thing is, I used to have a thing for Valentine...

216
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,490
Really? You never said a word about it.

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,260
Say, Albert... Do you remember when we came out here on a drive?

218
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,560
Yeah...

219
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,540
It was just a little while ago, but it feels like a distant memory.

220
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,170
That quiche that Valentine shared with us was great, wasn't it?

221
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,440
Albert...

222
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,650
Sorry, I was just remembering that day.

223
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,820
Franz is a lucky guy.

224
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,130
You're always thinking about him.

225
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,770
I only have machines to soothe my troubled heart now!

226
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,410
Renaud...

227
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,810
C'mon, let's head back and grab something to eat.

228
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,080
Sure.

229
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,030
Hey! Michelle!
We're being swamped with sell-offs!

230
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,230
What are you doing?

231
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,280
I am trying as best I can to prop up the prices, but I am unable to keep up with the volume.

232
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,320
Sink all the money we have into it to stop the slide!

233
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,870
It isn't just our bank stocks or those of our business group that are crashing.

234
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,300
Every stock that we have invested in is in a nosedive.

235
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,910
Why is this happening?

236
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,980
I am unable to determine the cause.

237
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,820
"Unable to determine the cause"?!

238
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,890
Pull it together, damn it!
If this keeps up, I'll go bankrupt!

239
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,890
Infection by unknown virus detec... ted...

240
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,710
Michelle?

241
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,460
...ted...

242
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
The Eastern market is open now.

243
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,130
...ted...

244
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,400
Pull out our shares! Sell off everything but our bank stocks!

245
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,060
...ted...

246
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,100
Convert it to cash!

247
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,070
Today's weather in Paris is sunny... sunny.

248
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,530
Current temperature is 22 Celsi... sunny... with less than a 10% chance of precipita... sunny.

249
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Hey!

250
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,780
It is shaping up to be a pleasant day... sunny.

251
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,250
Hey! Michelle! Snap out of it!

252
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,510
Michelle!

253
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,450
Sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny...

254
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,020
The Eastern market...

255
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,720
The Paris market closed today with prices considerably lower than yesterday's... sunny.

256
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,720
Michelle, start running these numbers immediately!

257
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,910
The prevailing opinion is that the market turned against overextended businesses...

258
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,430
I can't keep up with it by myself!

259
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,690
...as a result of the sudden sell-off of Danglars Group stocks.

260
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,690
Michelle...

261
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,400
Sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny...

262
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,400
Michelle!

263
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,160
At the outbreak of this market run... sunny, sunny, sunny...

264
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,760
...the influx of capital from outer space sources was...

265
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,760
Michelle!

266
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,380
Father? What's the matter?
Why are you barging in like this?

267
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,820
Eugenie, dear daughter of mine...
I have something to tell you.

268
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,710
Something to tell me?

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,330
Yes. Something wonderful.

270
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,470
The thing is, your wedding with Andrea has been set for the day after tomorrow.

271
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,470
Why did you do that?! I told that you I can't get married so soon after Franz died!

272
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,730
That's all right.

273
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,540
Father!

274
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,270
Shut your mouth!

275
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,650
Are you saying that you don't care if l... no, this entire family...

276
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,970
...dies penniless in a ditch somewhere thanks to your self-centeredness?!

277
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,910
Father, calm down.

278
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,780
Calm down?!
How am I supposed to calm down?!

279
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,120
My stocks have taken a nosedive! They aren't worth the paper they're printed on now!

280
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,720
Give up on this worthless piano nonsense of yours!

281
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,730
You're not serious...

282
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,860
You're the only one who can save this family.

283
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,640
You've got to marry Andrea right away!

284
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,370
But what about my feelings?

285
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,910
They don't matter.

286
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,450
All that matters to me is that I get my money back.

287
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,290
Thanks to this, Andrea's fortune will be mine!

288
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,820
Eugenie, at this moment, you're the most precious thing in the world to me.

289
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,870
Franz is still here with us.

290
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,740
That's the way
I see it.

291
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:02,650
I get the feeling that he's showing us what path we have to take.

292
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,000
Renaud...

293
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,840
And where might you be going at this late hour?

294
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,270
No! Stop it!

295
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,860
Let go!

296
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,370
No!

297
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,740
No!

298
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,780
Even the daughter of an aristocrat would be ruined for life if something like this is done to her, wouldn't she?

299
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,520
Wouldn't she?!

300
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,390
The day after tomorrow, you're going to belong to me.

301
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,200
The main course will have to wait until then...

302
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
Albert, save me...

303
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,400
Albert!

304
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

305
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

306
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

307
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

308
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

309
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

310
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

311
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

312
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

313
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

314
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,500
Don't give up on your future.

315
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,180
No matter the time, no matter the place, you're never alone.

316
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,510
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 20:

317
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,170
Act 20:
Farewell, Eugenie

318
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,110
..."Farewell, Eugenie".

319
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,680
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
