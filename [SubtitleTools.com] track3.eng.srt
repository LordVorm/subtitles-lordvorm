1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,860
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,090
When he learned something of his mother's past,

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,280
...the young man saw in her profile the figure of a woman.

21
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,900
However, he is still unaware.

22
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,800
Still unaware of the true identity of the man who brought this look to her face.

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,060
Act 5:
Do You Love Your Fiancée?

24
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,110
I can't believe I'm seeing sights like this underneath the Champs Elysees.

25
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,920
It's like a dream.

26
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,750
Perhaps this truly is but a dream.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,220
At times, I find myself forced to consider that possibility.

28
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,260
In that case, here's an eye-opening question for you. How much did you sink into this?

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,770
How much did this dream house of yours set you back?

30
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,700
We stopped bothering with hassles like keeping track of the money halfway through construction.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,470
Thanks for that reply.
It'll make a great headline.

32
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,410
Where's that music coming from?

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,090
There!

34
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,700
She's the girl from the opera!

35
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,870
She's beautiful...

36
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,500
You're not gonna try and tell us
that she's artificial, too, are you?

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,570
Don't be rude!
She's...

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,610
She is a doll named Haidee.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,150
A poor puppet who still lives, even
after her soul has been stolen away.

40
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,850
Haidee obeys my every whim,

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,450
...and should I wish it, would not hesitate to take her own life.

42
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,920
You're kidding...

43
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,990
Don't be so surprised. This is the Count of Monte Cristo we're talking about.

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,190
He renounced his soul ages ago.

45
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,660
Am I wrong?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,770
You're going too far,
Beauchamp!

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,570
How else could a man amass a fortune like this in one lifetime?

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm afraid... I must agree.

49
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,710
Why are you all acting like this?

50
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,950
Listen, the Count isn't as cold a man as you think he is.

51
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,510
Isn't that right,
Count?

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,680
I would not know.
I cannot see myself.

53
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,670
Welcome to our home.
I am Haidee.

54
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,970
H-Hello.

55
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,910
Who's that?

56
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,150
He is Ali. Like Haidee, he is a noble doll that I own.

57
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,220
Haidee, the Viscount seems perplexed...

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,960
...as to what you are to me.

59
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,050
I am but a humble twig that allows the Count to bloom.

60
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,070
A graceful girl like her is the twig, and the Count is the flower, huh?

61
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,270
Are you happy like this?

62
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,910
I know the joy of making the flowers bloom.

63
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,250
But...

64
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,290
Does my harp's music sound gloomy?

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,810
No.

66
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,450
The notes of a harp are the notes of the heart.

67
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,950
The strings don't respond to a hesitant, timid heart,

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,230
...and a tense heart will cause the strings to break.

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,340
Being with the Count makes me happy.

70
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,840
I assumed that you and the Count were in love with one another...

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,100
In love with each other, huh?
Could you be any more naive?

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,050
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,480
Think about it.

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,750
Marriage among aristocrats is just a strategic alliance with the goal of cementing fortunes.

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,190
In point of fact, that's why Franz and Valentine are engaged, right?

76
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,690
Is that true?!

77
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,830
Well, I won't deny it...

78
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,730
Right, Albert? Isn't it the same with you and Eugenie?

79
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
Well, I guess...

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,070
In other words, love is something that doesn't exist in the privileged class.

81
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,480
How can this be...

82
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,790
What's the matter,
Maximilien?

83
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,370
Is what I said too hard to swallow?

84
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,240
No.

85
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,330
Even so, everything I said was the truth.

86
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,730
The only thing that's important to them is keeping their family fortune from shrinking.

87
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,110
In other words, you two aren't the product of love, you're the product of financial interests.

88
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,480
I wouldn't be so sure.

89
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,380
For my parents at least, they say that their marriage was out of love.

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,890
I find that hard to believe. A notorious player like General Morcerf?

91
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,050
Are you trying to insult my father?!

92
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,390
Seeing you get so mad about it makes it seem even more dubious.

93
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,330
Is there something about your parents that you're feeling guilty about?

94
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,660
Of course not.

95
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,880
Why would I feel guilty about anything?

96
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,370
Hey, Beauchamp.

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,570
I don't care if you think you're a journalist.
You should drop this subject.

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,280
Hey, what's this? You're clamping
down on freedom of speech now?

99
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,340
"How wretched it all is..."
Is that not what you are thinking,

100
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,590
...my good
Captain Morrel?

101
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,050
To think that loveless marriages are allowed to go unquestioned...

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,970
Is something wrong,
Maximilien?

103
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,370
The people of Paris are corrupt!

104
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,540
Maximilien, you're going too far!!
I demand that you take that back!

105
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,070
I can't do that.

106
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,780
Paris has more than its fair share of honest, upright people! Take back what you said!

107
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,480
I can't do that.

108
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,220
Take it back!

109
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,350
I can't.

110
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,670
Stop it, Albert!

111
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,490
Hey, now...

112
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Stop it.

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,030
Viscount Morcerf.

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,270
Do you realize what you are pointing at me?

115
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,610
I must warn you,
I am a soldier.

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,090
This will not do.

117
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,250
It is unseemly for one party to draw his sword while the other does not.

118
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,590
Count?

119
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,030
It appears to me that each of you is steadfast in your opinion.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,860
As we are at sea, perhaps we pirates should act the part...

121
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,260
...and have a duel?

122
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,630
A duel?

123
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,300
On the sea, strength counts for everything.

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,440
He with the better sword arm makes the rules.

125
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,980
Are you serious?

126
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,910
What are you suggesting, Count?!

127
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,050
Come, now is the time to demonstrate your conviction.

128
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,190
Prove to them that you hold your parents' marriage to be sacred.

129
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,960
The blade in your hand is invincible.

130
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,770
And you, Monsieur?

131
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,170
All men have a blade in their heart.

132
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,870
The purer the heart, the keener the blade.

133
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,480
The time is high tide, the place is the ship's bow, and the weapons are bare blades!

134
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,990
Come on, gentlemen!

135
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,530
Let's see you go at it, pirate style!

136
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,100
It's hard to believe that there are still people in this day and age who'd fight a duel over love...

137
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,770
Is this any time to be joking?!
Those swords are real!

138
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,000
And the water down there is teeming with sharks that are thirsting for human blood!

139
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,010
Count, what are you trying to do?!

140
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
Sea voyages are accompanied by their own entertainment.

141
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,750
I expect that Monsieur Albert is
thirsting for stimulation of this sort.

142
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,990
Let's do it!

143
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,620
Whenever you're ready.

144
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,960
Take back what you said!

145
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,660
I can't!

146
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,740
Why, you...!

147
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,100
How about now?!

148
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,770
You poor, sad people...

149
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,220
The purer the heart, the keener the blade.

150
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,820
You aren't capable of defeating me.

151
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,520
Shut up!

152
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,890
Understand this.

153
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,800
No matter what you say, no matter
how it is with other families,

154
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,110
...my parents' marriage is a sacred bond!

155
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,020
I didn't expect you to turn towards your unarmed side.

156
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,110
I admire your agility.

157
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,810
Nevertheless, the insincere will be smitten by righteous anger!

158
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,490
I won't stand for it!
I won't!

159
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,590
What in the world's gotten into Maximilien?

160
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,100
I guess he's the scrupulous type.

161
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,230
You're finished!

162
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,870
Why do you have such disdain for the aristocracy?!

163
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,500
That's none of your concern!

164
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,740
The hell it isn't!
Tell me why!

165
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,970
In that case, there's something
I want to ask you, too!

166
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,410
Is it true that you don't love your fiancée?

167
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,680
Well, l...

168
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,250
I demand an answer!

169
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,750
I don't know!

170
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,490
As I thought, I can't abide by this!

171
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,570
You have lost, Monsieur.

172
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,520
Hey, hold it!

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,320
Albert!

174
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,900
- Albert!
- Don't!

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,530
There are sharks down there!

176
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,940
This is a nightmare...

177
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,530
Indeed it is.

178
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,570
This is a dream.

179
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,740
All is but a waking dream.

180
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,660
Albert...

181
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,830
Mother...

182
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,200
I did it because you had that look on your face, Mother...

183
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,580
Count...

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,980
One cannot fight destiny.

185
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,710
I'm ashamed of myself.
I can't believe how angry I got.

186
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,090
I can see it clearly.

187
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,160
Within your heart, another side of yourself lies dormant.

188
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,130
At the moment, you are burdened with a profound sense of apprehension.

189
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,930
As am I.

190
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,270
You are, Count?

191
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,510
I have need of you.

192
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,740
Who, me?

193
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,870
You and I met that day on Luna.

194
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,290
Perhaps you feel that our meeting was a chance encounter.

195
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,030
But in fate, there are no coincidences.

196
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,420
Just as that setting sun does so
according to the laws of the universe,

197
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,160
...fate, too, is composed of unyielding necessity.

198
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,880
What are you apprehensive about, Count?

199
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,550
It is because a man loves that he laughs, cries, and hates.

200
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,020
Count, what are you saying?

201
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,850
My life is much like this miniature garden.

202
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,030
It is a hollow, fragile thing.

203
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,780
C'mon, Albert, cheer up already.
Maximilien already apologized, didn't he?

204
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm not mad.

205
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,510
Then why...

206
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,800
Don't hang around the Count anymore.

207
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,370
You've been acting funny lately.

208
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,260
You're right.
I guess I have.

209
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,270
Something's funny.
Something about all this.

210
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,680
Up until yesterday, life was one uneventful day after another.

211
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,780
It almost feels like something hidden is at work behind all this.

212
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,160
Destiny... Have you ever thought about fate and stuff like that?

213
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,160
No. I don't believe in that stuff.

214
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,900
How did your mother and I meet?

215
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,540
Why the sudden interest?

216
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,200
Please, I'd like to know.

217
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,700
As I've told you before, your mother and I were married after a storybook courtship.

218
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,940
Yes, it was just as your father says.
We were lovers.

219
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,390
I've never seen that look on Mother's face before.

220
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,890
You look like you're delirious with a fever, young master.

221
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,670
Why don't you go out for some fresh air?

222
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,900
Make sure you clean in here!

223
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,380
Yes, sir!

224
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,560
Mother, who are you thinking about right now?

225
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,110
How far will the ship sail,
I wonder?

226
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,350
There is no turning back now.

227
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,610
I see... You hope to expand your business ventures to include Paris, as well?

228
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,140
I can think of no stronger backer to
have than yourself, General Morcerf.

229
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,250
You do me a great honor,
Monte Cristo.

230
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,520
I take it that you already have a plan of action.

231
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,620
Please feel free to call on me should you have any need at all.

232
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,470
He seems to be quite powerful.

233
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,100
The crest of the Danglars family can be seen here and there around town.

234
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,150
He has no idea that the Count is keeping a close eye on him.

235
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,110
Talk about conceited.

236
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,120
Waving a sword around in anger like that...

237
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,490
You really are hopeless, you know that?

238
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,130
Tell me, what kind of relationship do you and I have?

239
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,830
What brought this on?

240
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,130
Something that
Maximilien said.

241
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,530
"Is it true that you don't love your fiancée?"

242
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh.

243
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,450
Do you, Albert?

244
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,920
You and I... are childhood friends, right?

245
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,990
You and Franz have changed.

246
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,920
In the old days, the three of us would always have fun together.

247
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,330
But now, the two of you sneak off on trips by yourselves...

248
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,600
Everybody is changing.

249
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,610
Do you know why Maximilien was so angry?

250
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,710
You honestly don't know?

251
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,780
Well, if you say so.

252
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,410
What's that supposed to mean?!

253
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,550
I guess no one can do anything to stop it...

254
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,980
...when two people have feelings for each other.

255
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,190
I didn't mean to keep you waiting, Eugenie.

256
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm sorry. It took a long time to get ready.

257
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,590
That's all right.

258
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,770
Oh, my. Albert, is something the matter?
You look so grim.

259
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,210
Stay safe.

260
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,580
Hey! Albert!

261
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,910
Albert!

262
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

263
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

264
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

265
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

266
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

267
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

268
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

269
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

270
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

271
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

272
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,950
She and her father.
And her mother.

273
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,490
The specter of uncertainty sneaks up on them through their conflicting emotions.

274
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,870
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 6:

275
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,660
Act 6:
Her Melancholy, My Melancholy

276
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,030
..."Her Melancholy,
My Melancholy".

277
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,530
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
