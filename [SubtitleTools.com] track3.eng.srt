1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,610
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,610
On that stormy day that announced the end of spring,

20
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,840
...my friend and I arrived in Paris, where the boy awaited us.

21
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,810
I tremble in silence at these emotions which leak out...

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,840
...as the hour of reunion draws near.

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,050
This must be your guest.

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,070
Count, if you don't mind, I'd like you to join us for dinner after you've met my parents.

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,450
Count?

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,720
If it is not too much trouble.

27
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,230
Please do. After all, we owe you our son's life.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,730
Welcome to our home,
my good Count of Monte Cristo.

29
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Act 4:
A Mother's Secrets

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,490
To our new friend, the
Count of Monte Cristo.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,090
Oh, is that so?

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,890
I'm embarrassed that you
know of the Janina campaign.

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,730
The people praise me as a hero,

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,570
...but to a soldier, such things mean little.

35
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,710
After all, nothing good ever results from destruction.

36
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,440
No, these idyllic times in which we live were built on the back of sacrifice.

37
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,310
Such is my opinion, at any rate.

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,890
I expect that the far corners of the galaxy are echoing...

39
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,110
...with the name of
General Morcerf by now.

40
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,590
You honor me by saying so.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,400
Oh, dear, the food wasn't to your liking?

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,640
Not at all. Please, think nothing of it.

43
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,140
I am in the habit of eating very little.

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,080
I can't say that I don't understand how you feel.

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,790
Having advanced in years, I find myself
weary of extravagant meals such as this.

46
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,660
In my case, I find lately that I seldom sleep, either.

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm amazed that you've managed to stay healthy.

48
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,600
It is because of these.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,270
Are they some sort of space rations?

50
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,440
In the course of wandering the sea of stars for so long,

51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,050
...my body and soul have changed beyond recognition.

52
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,370
Even so, I hope that you
would at least eat something...

53
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,150
The thought of neither sleeping nor eating is too sad to bear.

54
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,720
Too sad to bear?

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,360
Very well, then.

56
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,400
In that case, perhaps
I shall sample this.

57
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,900
Please do.

58
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,680
This taste brings back memories...

59
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,280
Brings back memories?

60
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,480
I once experienced delightful cooking such as this in the south of France.

61
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,320
This is the dish that you've made for as long as I can remember, right, Mother?

62
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,160
Yes.

63
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,660
By any chance, you wouldn't happen to be from Marseilles, would you?

64
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,830
No.

65
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,600
My wife has nothing to do
with such a barbaric province.

66
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,830
Isn't that right,
Mercedes?

67
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,600
Y-Yes...

68
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,570
Oh, really?

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,170
What's the matter?

70
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,450
One of my friends is from there.

71
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,480
His name is Maximilien Morrel.
He's a really nice person.

72
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,910
Morrel...

73
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,390
Forgive me if I misspoke.
Please, do not take offense.

74
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,660
That's all right.

75
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,630
Our family traces its roots back to a powerful Catalan family.

76
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,260
This soup has been a specialty of my
wife's ever since she was a young girl.

77
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,200
Oh, I see. So, you and the Countess were childhood friends, then?

78
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,470
Yes, that's right.

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,810
Which explains why you seem so close.
I am jealous beyond words.

80
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,140
I had no idea that a man like you could be jealous of anyone, Count.

81
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,690
Yes, of course.

82
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,480
If that person is a man of your father's caliber.

83
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,990
Get the Count something to drink.
His glass is empty.

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
Please stay for as long as time permits.

85
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,340
Sitting around the table like this, it almost feels as if you are a member of the family.

86
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,420
What a maddening scent this is...

87
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,950
Count?

88
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,420
It is from the muscat grapes.

89
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,460
Are you fatigued?

90
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,260
No, please forgive me for forcing you to eat earlier.

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Not at all. I had always hoped to
experience that delicious flavor again.

92
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,440
It was a sublime experience.

93
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,610
It was a simple rustic dish.

94
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,650
But it makes me happy to hear you say so.

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,780
Have you heard of this?
There is a saying that goes,

96
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,850
"Those who share bread and salt under the same roof become eternal friends."

97
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,200
That is a tradition handed down
in Eastern Space, is it not?

98
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,230
Yes.

99
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,200
Which means that we are now friends.
For all eternity.

100
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,600
However, this is not Eastern Space.
It is Paris.

101
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,810
In Paris, everlasting friendship is impossible without the act of sharing bread and salt.

102
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,950
Your soup truly was delicious.

103
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,350
Warm, and yet evocative of past memories.

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,190
It is something which gives comfort.

105
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,520
Like a breeze blowing across the Mediterranean Sea.

106
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,830
Count, are you very familiar with Marseilles?

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,800
I could say that
I am aware of it.

108
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,210
But perhaps I never truly knew it at all.

109
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,970
Infidelity. Adultery.
Dalliances in the dead of night.

110
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,310
You aristocrats are as energetic as the rumors say.

111
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,110
Spare me your crude comments!

112
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,150
The Count is a friend of mine.

113
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,980
Honestly, you're such a child.

114
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,320
If people could become friends simply by sharing bread and salt,

115
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,620
...life would be simpler.

116
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,990
What are you talking about?

117
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,960
You'll understand sooner or later, little boy.

118
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,640
I am most grateful to you for allowing me to experience a day such as today.

119
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,080
Not at all. I'm proud that I had the
opportunity to introduce you to my parents.

120
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,610
To introduce a man I admire.

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
What say you?

122
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,060
I would like to invite you to my residence on the Champs-Elysees in the near future.

123
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,660
I'd love to come!

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,390
The Count of Monte Cristo was a
mysterious man, don't you think?

125
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,400
Yes. There was a sternness somewhere in him that keeps people at arm's length.

126
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,500
That just means that compared to the Count, the people of Paris are dull.

127
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,410
My...

128
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,640
You might not know this, Mother, but there's more to the world than Paris.

129
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,080
Out beyond the walls, there's a world that's endlessly captivating.

130
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,950
I think you've changed since your journey to Luna.

131
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,150
My journey is just beginning.

132
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,490
Don't go to worlds too far removed from our own.

133
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,560
You should exercise moderation in your association with the Count.

134
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,160
Oh, please, Mother...
You sound just like Franz.

135
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,770
Well, even though he seems more than a little shady,

136
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,740
...having the Morcerf family establish ties with a man like him might not be a bad thing.

137
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,640
Not when this family is about to
throw its hat into the political arena.

138
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,950
Good grief, why do aristocrats
eat like this all the time?

139
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,280
Dinner parties, high tea, balls...

140
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,050
It's probably because they
don't have anything else to do.

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,650
In other words, if you took away the gluttony, lust, and avarice,

142
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,060
...there wouldn't be anything left.

143
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,500
You need to watch your mouth.

144
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,030
Didn't you think that their guest today was rather elegant and handsome?

145
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm not so sure.
He wasn't very refined.

146
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,240
Maybe, but he had a pretty good vibe going with the mistress under the grapevine trellis.

147
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,820
What, really? I'd always thought that the master was the only man in the world for the mistress.

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,480
I think that any society lady would fall for that Count if he worked his mojo on her.

149
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,450
Give it a rest, already!

150
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,890
That was definitely the face of a woman in love.

151
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,130
If you don't stop that,
I'm going to report you.

152
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,630
Oo, I'm so scared...

153
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,830
That's preposterous. Mother is the last person in the world who would be capable of...

154
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,110
Mother?

155
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,390
Who's in that picture she's looking at?

156
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,090
Do you find me a horrible man?

157
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,860
No. I will stay at your side for as long as I live.

158
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,430
Even if that means walking down the path to ruin.

159
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,100
It is not we who will be ruined.

160
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,900
I have come home,
Father.

161
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,010
What, you're still here?

162
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,780
Hey, don't touch those!

163
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,360
I hate to break it to you, but I've gotten into your father's good graces,

164
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,650
...so I'll be staying here for a while.

165
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,120
His "good graces"?

166
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,860
It means that your father is a man like any other.

167
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,330
Give those bad jokes a rest.

168
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,430
Well, setting aside your father for the moment,

169
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,870
...the one that I'd be worried about is your mother, you know?

170
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,640
What's that supposed to mean?

171
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,850
I mean, she was staring so wistfully at that picture of a young man...

172
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,800
You saw that?

173
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,110
It was definitely a picture of a man.

174
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,420
A man who wasn't your father.

175
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, I can understand.

176
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,980
If my mother was staring at a picture of some strange man,

177
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,530
...l'd be depressed, too.

178
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,030
That's about enough!
Get out!

179
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,390
Yes, sir!

180
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,050
Eugenie? I didn't know you were here.

181
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,180
Ever the late riser,
I see.

182
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,410
Why are you dressed like that?

183
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,210
What's wrong with it?

184
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,550
Skirts just don't work on you.

185
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,050
I didn't come here to see you, Albert!

186
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,550
Then don't have me dragged out of bed!

187
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,850
I'm the one who had you woken up, Albert.

188
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,860
Is something the matter?

189
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,870
No, ma'am.

190
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,400
Eugenie is your fiancee, isn't she?

191
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,240
I think it's only natural that you should greet her when she's over.

192
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,180
Sure, I suppose.
Um, are you going somewhere?

193
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,550
Oh, we're just going out to do a little shopping together.

194
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,550
Let's go, Madame!

195
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,720
Of course.

196
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,920
That reminds me. What's this I hear about the
Count of Monte Cristo inviting you over?

197
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,590
How did you know that?

198
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,160
I heard about it from Franz.

199
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,690
He said that he and Maximilien were also invited.

200
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,460
They were invited, too?

201
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,680
What's he...

202
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
Peppo!
What are you doing?

203
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,050
Oh, hi, Albert!

204
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,230
Don't you "Oh, hi!" me!
Don't play around with Mother's jewelry!

205
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,020
But they're so pretty!

206
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,500
If my father sees you like that,
there'll be hell to pay!

207
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,700
Fine, fine.
I'll put them back, then.

208
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,610
You're dying to know
what's in there, aren't you?

209
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,950
It's like your mother's secret
treasure is hidden inside.

210
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,720
Impossible.

211
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,020
Oh, there's no such thing as a human being who doesn't have secrets.

212
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,730
Just like you and I share a certain secret night.

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
That only happened because
I was tricked by you!

214
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,390
If you ever want that lock opened, come tell me anytime.

215
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,000
I specialize in getting into people's drawers.

216
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,700
Stop being crude, and get back to work!

217
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,300
Oh. Fine.

218
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,790
It can't be...

219
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,320
Why would Mother have a picture of the Count?

220
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,040
This is ridiculous.
What am I so worried about?

221
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,280
His Excellency General Morcerf!
Ten-hut!

222
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,070
All high and mighty...

223
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,580
How do I look?
Not too strange, I hope?

224
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,710
It looks wonderful on you.

225
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,050
What?

226
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,250
Thank goodness.
You're more upbeat than I expected.

227
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Gee, thanks.

228
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,500
For a visit to the Count's place, that outfit isn't quite flamboyant enough, don't you think?

229
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Not flamboyant enough?

230
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,470
Albert? What in the world are you wearing?

231
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,640
What's wrong with it?

232
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,080
Where do I even begin?

233
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,480
I'll never understand the ways of you aristocrats.

234
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,610
Why are you dressed like a pirate?!

235
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,050
Uh, what are you even doing here, Beauchamp?

236
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,860
You don't expect me to miss my chance to get photos of the Count's mansion, do you?

237
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,170
Oh, brother. And here I had hoped to go there by myself, if at all possible.

238
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,840
That day when I first met you, you made me realize that there is always hope,

239
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,570
...regardless of the circumstances you might find yourself in.

240
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,870
I will never forget that lesson.

241
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,380
Hope...

242
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,720
When I was flung out of the Chateau d'lf into the black void of space,

243
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,960
...hope was the one thing that I had in my possession.

244
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,800
You're sure this is it?

245
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,370
Yep. number thirty, Champs-Elysees.
No doubt about it.

246
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,350
It's a lot more austere than I expected it to be, considering the Count.

247
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,760
I was expecting the sort of place that would drive a commoner into a rage if he saw it.

248
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,640
Welcome, messieurs.
We have been expecting you.

249
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,600
Early Rococo, huh?
And not Revival, either.

250
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,910
Isn't this amazing?

251
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,110
Well, it's a bit too far removed from my world...

252
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,810
Please pardon the delay.
Allow me to show you to the Count.

253
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,760
What the...?

254
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
We're going down!

255
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,320
Baptistin, where are we going?

256
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,210
We've stopped!

257
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,910
Welcome, messieurs.
The Count awaits.

258
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,920
That's...

259
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,870
Even the floor and columns are gold...
The man has expensive tastes.

260
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,440
Where could he have gotten this much gold?

261
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,770
That's why I think there's something fishy about him.

262
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,890
At this rate, I bet his bed and
pillows are gonna be solid gold, too.

263
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,090
I'd never be able to fall asleep with all this glare.

264
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,380
Hey! Look at that!

265
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,260
That's...

266
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,800
The sea?

267
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,790
No, wait.
Look at that sky!

268
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,620
It's artificial?

269
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,260
I can't believe it...

270
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,340
This alone would make one hell of a story.

271
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,310
This is so beautiful...

272
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,610
Wait, I know this view!

273
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,350
That look suits you quite well, Sir Pirate.

274
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,690
Count!

275
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,420
Wha...?

276
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,370
If you don't mind, I would like
you to have this, Sir Pirate.

277
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,550
I was given this blade by a certain ship's navigator.

278
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:31,560
Perhaps it will serve to protect you, as well as to carve a path for you.

279
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be.

280
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems.

281
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you.

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear.

283
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming,

284
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
you won't see me coming

285
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
till I strike!

286
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming,

287
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
you won't see me coming

288
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
till I strike!

289
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,260
When we meet someone,

290
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,830
...the selfless, considerate part of us clashes with the selfish love of our emotions.

291
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,510
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 5,

292
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,580
Act 5:
Do You Love Your Fiancee?

293
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,870
..."Do You Love Your Fiancee?"

294
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,180
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
