1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,240
I was reunited with the young man at my friend's residence.

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,280
His soul, which does not know what it means to love another,

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,700
...was profoundly shaken by one who does know what it is to love.

21
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,670
He asked, "Do you love your fiancée?"

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,600
My life is a hollow, fragile thing.

23
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,870
I think we should give some more
thought to my marriage to Eugenie.

24
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,130
What brought this on?

25
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm just not sure if I really love her or not.

26
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,920
Pull!

27
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,060
That's what's been bothering you?

28
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,690
First you go through the motions.
Then the emotions will follow.

29
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,850
Pull!

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,780
Monsieur Albert, a messenger from the
Count of Monte Cristo said to deliver this to you.

31
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,320
From the Count?

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,910
Invitations to the opera...

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,160
"As luck would have it, I managed to secure an open box at the opera house."

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,370
"If you like, would you care to join me this evening?"

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,420
"By all means, please bring your fiancée."

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,130
I can't imagine how there could be any open boxes at the opera house...

37
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,090
You're right.

38
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,340
I'm sorry, but could you deliver this to Eugenie?

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,010
Albert, you're going to deliver it.

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Father?

41
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,640
Considerate little touches like
this will win her over little by little.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,350
Pull!

43
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,350
Act 6:
Her Melancholy, My Melancholy

44
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't wake her this morning.

45
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,740
Is Monsieur Debray here?

46
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,830
Here comes Mademoiselle!

47
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,120
Good morning, Mademoiselle.

48
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,460
Good morning.
Is Mother still sleeping?

49
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,250
Yes, Mademoiselle, it looks that way.

50
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,740
Good morning, Eugenie.
You're as lovely as ever.

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,700
Good morning.

52
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,990
You spent the night, I see.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,880
Father, your soup is getting cold.

54
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,050
Yes, of course...

55
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,260
Good morning, Baron.

56
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,470
Hello. I trust you slept well last night?

57
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,890
Yes, sir. Thank you for your hospitality.

58
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,560
By the way, about Olympus Trading...

59
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,860
I'm sure of it.

60
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,450
That's a valuable piece of information... Thank you!

61
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,240
I give appropriate compensation to those who give me information before anyone else.

62
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,790
If you're not in a hurry, would you care to join us for breakfast?

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,340
Thank you for the invitation.

64
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,760
I was on my way to give
Eugenie her ticket.

65
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,100
I am on my way to visit Baron Danglars to see to some business negotiations.

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,610
What a lucky coincidence!
Please, allow me to introduce you to them!

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,150
This is indeed an unexpected stroke of good luck.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,990
There are many things at their estate
that you will find interesting.

69
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,580
That reminds me, if you have time, you should ask them to show you the stables.

70
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,330
Madame Danglars has a horse named Eclipse that is the finest in all of Paris.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,300
This way, Messieurs. If you will wait in the parlor for a moment...

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
Albert!

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,380
Lucien! What brings you here so early in the morning?

74
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Oh, I had my hands full with this and that.

75
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,850
Eugenie!
Good morning!

76
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,020
A man has to play his cards right.

77
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,230
Right?

78
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,110
Count! Do me the honor of allowing me to invite you to my home next time.

79
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,940
Of course. Gladly.

80
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,990
That reminds me,
I'll stop by your room later!

81
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,500
Michelle, Olympus Trading has started to fall.

82
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,970
We'll pretend to prop it up, and then make it fall even farther!

83
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,550
Further buying is inadvisable.
It is below the insolvency line.

84
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,220
I don't care. Wait until it hits bottom,
and then buy them out.

85
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,930
Understood.

86
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,270
A few hundred investors are gonna hang themselves over this.

87
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,360
Monsieur, the Count of Monte Cristo is waiting in the parlor.

88
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,110
He is, eh?

89
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,990
Michelle, have the credit assessment results...

90
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,820
...for this Count of Monte Cristo person come in yet?

91
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,950
Out of three investigatory agencies, two rate him as AA+,

92
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,740
...and the third rates him as AAA.

93
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
His peerage title is valid, as well.

94
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,330
I bet. He probably paid a lot of money for it.

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm terribly sorry to keep you waiting.

96
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,300
Oh, you're here, too, Albert?

97
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,640
Good morning, Baron.
This is the Count of Monte Cristo.

98
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,350
I had hoped to put in a good word for him.

99
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,390
His Excellency mentioned that he doesn't have a bank,

100
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,190
...so I thought I should introduce him to you, Baron.

101
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
That was most considerate of you.

102
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,900
I'm always glad to meet fine new customers.

103
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,580
Allow me to introduce Baron Danglars, the most powerful banker in Paris right now.

104
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,160
It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

105
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,750
Look, you missed a spot over here, too!

106
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,090
You need to be more careful with Eclipse's grooming.

107
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,630
Yes, Madame.

108
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,470
And never give him anything but the feed I've specified.

109
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes, Madame.

110
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,100
I've received a letter of introduction and contract papers...

111
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,890
...from the firm of Thomson & French.

112
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,900
To tell you the truth, I'm amazed that they would act as guarantor for an individual.

113
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,530
They are the largest banking firm in Eastern Space.

114
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,530
Indeed they are. However, there is one item in this contract that concerns me.

115
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,830
That concerns you?

116
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,460
According to this, no upper limit has been set to your line of credit.

117
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,960
In short, it could be interpreted that my bank...

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,550
...would have to indefinitely continue to provide you...

119
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,670
...with any amount you wished, no matter how great the sum.

120
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,300
And does that present a problem?

121
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,220
This is a bit of an awkward situation.

122
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,730
You say it as if it were nothing, but such lopsided deals don't exist in this world.

123
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,860
Be that as it may, the firm of Thomson & French have judged that in my case, they do.

124
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,320
Surely you don't doubt the validity of this contract?

125
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,450
Not at all, its authenticity has already
been verified. This contract is genuine.

126
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,620
Oh, I see. In which case, you are saying...

127
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,160
...that it is me that you are unable to trust.

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,770
I got tickets to tonight's opera from the Count.

129
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,690
About that Count of Monte Cristo fellow...

130
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,860
Apparently, he managed to secure a box at the opera house.

131
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,820
He's quite a skilled player.

132
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,400
So it would seem.

133
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,700
Why don't we go pay our respects
during intermission tonight?

134
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,120
One, two, three...

135
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,710
Five?

136
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,830
F-Five hundred million?!

137
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,000
I had planned to open an account today and deposit these.

138
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,050
My intent was to let the interest from the deposit accrue in the account.

139
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,760
But I see that you are not interested.

140
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,930
N-Not at all...

141
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,810
You leave me no choice, then.
I shall try another bank.

142
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,400
Please! W-Wait!

143
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,070
Wait...

144
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,910
Lucien sure is a go-getter, coming over to talk business with your father so early in the day.

145
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,330
You really are a child, aren't you?

146
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
I can't believe you actually admire a guy like him.

147
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,710
"A guy like him"?
He's our friend!

148
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,460
I've never thought of him as a friend.

149
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,090
We've been together since we were kids!

150
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,180
That "friend" of ours is sleeping with my mother.

151
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,900
We are agreed, then. I will deposit these in your account right away.

152
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,820
I shall send over a servant later to pick up my first loan.

153
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,280
Very well.

154
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,110
Incidentally, it has recently come to my attention...

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,450
...that you own the finest horse in all of Paris, Baron.

156
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,660
Oh, you have an interest in horses, Count?

157
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,750
English thoroughbreds in particular.

158
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,920
The thought had occurred to me to purchase it from you.

159
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,460
Name your price.

160
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,630
Surely you joke!

161
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,930
That horse belongs to my wife.
I have no intention of selling it.

162
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,560
For the right price, everything is for sale.

163
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,940
I should think that you would
know that better than anyone, Baron.

164
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,410
This is terrible! Monsieur Danglars has sold Madame's horse!

165
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,660
He sold Eclipse?

166
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,330
Yes, Mademoiselle!
Just now!

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,540
They're going to fight again...

168
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,760
Monsieur Danglars said that he was offered a huge sum. He seemed very excited.

169
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,920
It was the Count...

170
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,010
What is it?
You're interrupting us.

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,770
I'm terribly sorry, Count. This is my wife.

172
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,390
This is the Count of Monte Cristo.

173
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,190
Where is my horse!
Where is my Eclipse?!

174
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,690
I was going to discuss this with you later.

175
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,990
Count, if you would kindly excuse us for a moment.

176
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,490
You sold Eclipse?!

177
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,040
Keep your voice down!
Look, don't let this shock you...

178
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,920
That horse was worth 5.8 million Francs, and the Count bought him for 20 million!

179
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,670
Eclipse was my horse!

180
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,920
Look, that horse was worth...

181
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,170
This isn't about the money!

182
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,050
I promised Madame Villefort
that she could use him tomorrow!

183
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,850
You have lots of other horses!

184
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,010
I refuse to use any horse but Eclipse!

185
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,850
Get in there and cancel the deal this instant!

186
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,440
What's this nonsense?

187
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,860
You had no right to sell my horse!

188
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,740
My good Baroness, if I have upset a beautiful lady such as yourself, I must apologize.

189
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,990
I had thought that if I offered 60 million, you would find the amount satisfactory.

190
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,330
But we each have things that are so precious to us that a price cannot be put upon them.

191
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,250
Please pardon my ineptitude at failing
to take that into consideration.

192
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,260
Oh, my...
That's quite all right.

193
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,970
But just a moment... Did I hear you say 60 million just now?

194
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Indeed, Madame. I offered to pay 60 million in gold.

195
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,350
Oh, I see. Please pardon my silly question.

196
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,440
In that case, I will take my leave now.

197
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,990
I shall respect Madame's wishes and do my utmost to remedy the situation.

198
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,990
Count...

199
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,460
Monsieur, were you planning to pocket a percentage of the profits, even from me?!

200
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,750
You've got it all wrong!

201
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,800
You and your filthy lies!

202
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,090
Come to my room later!

203
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,970
Come on, Albert, let's go somewhere.

204
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,680
Shouldn't we do something?

205
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,300
They're always like this.

206
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,310
Go faster.

207
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,820
I can't go any faster.

208
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,820
They're the worst...

209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,570
The worst family, and the worst father...

210
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,990
You mean the world to the Baron.

211
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,620
You don't know him at all, do you?

212
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,880
If the price was right, he'd sell me off without giving it a second thought.

213
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,010
As long as we stay here, we'll never be able to get out from under our parents' thumbs.

214
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,520
I want to live more freely.

215
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,520
I love the piano. I want to play all over the world.

216
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,020
Eugenie...

217
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,030
I want to live somewhere far away.
Somewhere that my parents can't reach me.

218
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,910
Then let's go.

219
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,000
You and me.
Let's leave home.

220
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,930
Idiot.

221
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,600
Why am I an idiot?

222
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,850
Let's go back. I have to get fitted for my dress tonight.

223
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,850
I thought you wanted to leave here! Hey!

224
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,680
Hey, where's Valentine?

225
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,890
What about you?
I thought you were coming with Eugenie.

226
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,980
It's true! He even comes to me in my dreams!

227
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,030
Do you want to know what he said to me?

228
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,240
What did he say?

229
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,450
Good evening!

230
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,580
Good evening.

231
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,790
I was given an invitation, too, but I feel a bit out of place.

232
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,880
Not at all.
It looks wonderful on you.

233
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,380
Um... It's a loaner.

234
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,370
But I thought that the Prince's booth had been sealed up ever since that incident.

235
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,830
It's been 20 years since that horrible accident, hasn't it?

236
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,630
I heard that someone has put it on permanent reserve.

237
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,340
It's unnerving, isn't it? It's as if the late Prince has returned.

238
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,840
Come now, let's stop talking about such frightful things.

239
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,910
What a handsome gentleman...

240
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,210
Who is the young lady next to him?

241
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,550
I don't know, but she's so lovely, isn't she?

242
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,890
Albert, who is your friend?

243
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,890
Madame!

244
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,640
What?! Don't make such a racket...

245
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,310
Your horse, Madame!
Eclipse has returned!

246
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,940
What did you say?!

247
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,490
A new set of box seats was unveiled today.

248
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,040
It must be Monte Cristo.

249
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,700
Where are his seats?

250
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
That's...
That's the late Prince's box!

251
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,380
What's the meaning of this?!

252
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,210
I haven't been informed of any of the details, Monsieur.

253
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,790
How can this be?!

254
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,710
I can't believe it!

255
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,420
His Excellency the Count of Monte Cristo ordered me to give this to Madame...

256
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,170
...as both an apology and as a getting-acquainted gift.

257
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,470
Oh, I don't know what to say!
What a wonderful gift!

258
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,310
Deposit of 4.5 trillion dollars from
Vanderbilt Far East of Cygnus Alpha.

259
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,480
Deposit of 328 trillion pesos from the Space Canal
Corporation in the Union of Northern Sanctuaries.

260
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,650
Deposit of
14.2 billion pounds...

261
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,530
...from Gravity Advanced Materials
of the United Central Emirates.

262
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,910
Deposit after deposit of foreign currency...

263
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,490
...is being made into the Count of Monte Cristo's account.

264
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,660
Who the hell is that man?

265
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,660
Where is he making all this money?

266
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,710
Oh, the Count of Monte Cristo!
What a magnificent man he is!

267
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,300
What a magnificent man!

268
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,340
Michelle, that man is hiding something.

269
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,350
I detect no suspicious activity.

270
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,430
Leave no stone unturned. Run thorough checks on everyone he does business with.

271
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,640
Understood.

272
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,990
That's the man...

273
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,910
That's the man who...

274
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be.

275
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems.

276
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you.

277
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear.

278
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming,

279
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
you won't see me coming

280
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
till I strike!

281
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming,

282
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
you won't see me coming

283
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
till I strike!

284
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Hoping to help a friend with the
feelings that he secretly harbors,

285
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,250
...I go to visit Valentine.

286
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,550
But what I witness there is...

287
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Act 7:
The Secret Flower Garden

288
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,010
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, Act 7:

289
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,550
..."The Secret
Flower Garden."

290
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,720
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
