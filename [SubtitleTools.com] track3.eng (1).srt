1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,230
Friendship is something that is both fascinating and beautiful.

19
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,100
It was thanks to its power that the boy was able to escape the bandits' clutches.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,830
"And yet", my friend said to me,

21
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,490
"there is nothing so inconstant as the human heart".

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Act 3:
5/22, Stormy

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,670
Hey! Albert!

24
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,100
Wake up!

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,010
I can't believe you were still in bed.

26
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,710
I have an important visitor coming today.
I've been really busy.

27
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,050
You didn't have to come if you don't want to.

28
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,450
Who's the visitor?

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,220
Someone who did me a favor on Luna.

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh, that fake Count something-or-other.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,420
Eugenie! That's going too far!

32
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,460
Speaking of visitors, Renaud said that he's bringing someone, too.

33
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,100
What?

34
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,670
You know, Albert, you must be
the perfect target for a con artist.

35
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,810
She's losing her temper...

36
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,070
What are you angry about?

37
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,570
Who says I'm angry?
I'm just enjoying our drive.

38
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,240
This isn't a race.

39
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,870
Oh, that's right. You love puttering around at a crawl with no destination in mind.

40
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,180
Both behind the wheel and in life.

41
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,920
My life is none of your business!

42
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,060
Get out.

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,440
Sure, just watch me.
I don't want to ride with you, anyway.

44
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,950
What are you talking about?
We're already here.

45
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,090
For the life of me, I can't figure
out why you and I are engaged!

46
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,630
Then maybe you should ride in Debray's car on the way...

47
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, boy...

48
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,840
Hey, would you be careful?

49
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,700
Are you okay?

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,710
Yes.

51
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,910
Hey, Albert!
Come take a look!

52
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,370
Hey!

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,890
Geez, are women all you're good at
handling, Mr. Bigshot private secretary?

54
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,190
Every dull drive needs a little stimulation, doesn't it?

55
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,720
Next to me is a hack newspaper reporter,

56
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,190
...and in the back seat is a couple who just got engaged!

57
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,310
That was amazing!

58
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,150
It was nothing. I was in a special forces unit in the army.

59
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,720
Muscle reinforcement processing, huh?
I'd heard rumors about it...

60
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,680
Thank you for your assistance.

61
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,830
I-I'll get it myself.

62
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,110
Um... What is your name, if I might ask?

63
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,410
It's Valentine.

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
I-I'm...

65
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,950
Hey, Maximilien!
Sorry I'm late!

66
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,490
There I was, out on recon, and I stumbled into an enemy nest.

67
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,860
And when I accidentally dropped my
favorite grenade, I went as pale as a ghost!

68
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,430
From inside the hole, I could hear the
Erindanians making threatening clicking noises.

69
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,400
Anyway, I don't subscribe to the theory that they're a sentient race.

70
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,580
In temperament, they're vicious and cruel.

71
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,980
Would you like a piece?

72
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,590
Thank you.

73
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,550
Well, I don't want to go into detail with these ladies present,

74
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,550
...but just once, they ought to round up those human rights proponents...

75
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,760
It's delicious!

76
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,230
...and send 'em in there to have a nice chat with them!

77
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,020
You're a lucky man, Franz!

78
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,320
Once you're married, you'll be able to eat like this every day!

79
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,600
Um... Where was I?

80
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,400
Oh, right! Just then, I thought
I was done for!

81
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,100
And who do you suppose showed up then?

82
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,340
None other than Space Cavalry
Captain Maximilien Morrel,

83
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,750
...the man I owe my life to!

84
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,580
You're quite a man to look after a klutz who stumbled his way onto a battlefield.

85
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,380
Where do you hail from?

86
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,960
My family is from Marseilles.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,930
That's a rough place.

88
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,590
And you?

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,030
Paris, of course!
Admittedly, from the old part of town.

90
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,040
Marseilles... What sort of place is it?

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,500
When I was young, it was a beautiful harbor town.

92
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,940
At any rate, it's not a place that a young lady should venture into.

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,540
We haven't climbed up here in a long time.

94
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,170
What a great breeze.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,440
Those clouds look a bit menacing, though.

96
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,310
Something interesting catch your eye?

97
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,970
Why do you suppose there's a need to divide the world with city walls?

98
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,820
The ugliness of the outside world exists for the express purpose of making the beauty of our kingdom stand out all the more.

99
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,590
Maybe, but there's plenty of great things outside the walls.

100
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,260
Don't you think we should open our eyes a little more?

101
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,630
Oh, have you grown up a little from going on your trip?

102
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,130
I suppose you're right.

103
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,430
So go ahead and take on all the troubles that exist outside the walls.

104
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,300
That should quiet those pangs
of boredom of yours a little.

105
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,940
That is what we should be looking at.

106
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,610
The High Court of Justice.
Danglars Bank.

107
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,150
And the place your father works at,
Space Forces Imperial Headquarters.

108
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,250
The triangle of power.

109
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,820
That is the true "great thing" that we should inherit, don't you think?

110
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,170
To me, it feels like we're the ones who have been sealed in.

111
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,810
I am now no longer alone in my solitude.

112
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,530
For I am now surrounded by the Furies, the goddesses of vengeance.

113
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,520
In the darkness,
I awaited the dawn.

114
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,640
And once dawn came, I cursed my flesh until night fell once more.

115
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,440
I even prayed that I would lose my sanity.

116
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,010
But those prayers went unheeded.

117
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:17,950
I even strove for death, but the Devil's cold, pitiless hand held me back.

118
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,990
Soon...
It won't be long now...

119
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,640
Boy, what a lousy drive that was...

120
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,740
Maybe it was punishment for
skipping the Cabinet meeting...

121
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,660
Have the candidates for the next
President been chosen yet?

122
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,120
The word on the street is that
His Excellency Morcerf is the front runner.

123
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,320
You've heard a few things from your father, right, Albert?

124
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,120
Maximilien, you should watch your step around Beauchamp.

125
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,840
He's a terrible man who will use even his friends' scandals as fodder for articles, and he won't think twice about it.

126
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,230
That's what they call
"impartial journalism".

127
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,560
I read your articles all the time.

128
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,230
But I do not approve of the content.

129
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,400
I get that all the time.

130
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,520
Where are the ladies?

131
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,190
They went home, saying something about their dresses being soaked.

132
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,940
Renaud's antique, too.

133
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,660
If they'd said something, I would have given them a lift home.

134
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,090
That'd be like tossing food to a monkey.

135
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,880
So, the Count of
Monte Cristo, huh?

136
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,080
I can't say that the name is familiar.

137
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,120
There's no documents on him at the Cabinet Secretariat, either. It's probably an alias. Or maybe...

138
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,230
A pretender or a con man, huh?

139
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,200
I'll thank you to stop engaging in idle gossip
about an honored guest of the Morcerf home.

140
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,870
Where'd you say that you ran into this
"honored guest" of yours, again?

141
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,900
At Luna's Carnival this past spring.

142
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,610
Apparently, the honored son of the family was abducted by bandits.

143
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,380
That's too funny. Were you seduced by one of Luna's wily vixens?

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,650
Damn it...

145
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,030
And that's when the Count rescued me from their clutches.

146
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,110
I guess you owe him your life, then.

147
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,710
It's clear that he's incredibly
wealthy, as well as very kind.

148
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,940
And would you say that this millionaire's money pouch was stuffed full of forged bills?

149
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,280
Look at this!

150
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,760
If he wasn't of noble birth, would he have a watch as beautiful as this?

151
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,800
Con artists use trinkets like that all the time to win people's trust.

152
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,300
He's no con artist!

153
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,890
He commands a huge spaceship, he travels with aliens and a woman of unmatched beauty from Eastern Space,

154
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,640
...he's free from the rule of any government,

155
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,040
...and he mingles freely with people of all classes.

156
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,350
In everything he does, he breaks with tradition.

157
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:05,720
And then, once night falls, he wanders the darkness in search of the lifeblood of beautiful maidens.

158
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,750
I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

159
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,990
The Count has a ruthless side that
doesn't care about human life at all.

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,190
Franz!

161
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,870
Calm down, Albert!

162
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,540
You know, there was a case of a sailor who contracted a local disease on some planet,

163
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,580
...and went around sucking all the blood he could find, wasn't there?

164
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,190
You should be careful, too, Albert.

165
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,120
I hear they prefer the blood of virgin girls and boys.

166
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,630
You think he's a vampire or something?
That's ridiculous.

167
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,690
It's a lot more plausible than Lunar bandits.

168
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,090
Or kindhearted rich people.

169
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,240
His Excellency, the Count of Monte Cristo.

170
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,500
Show him in at once.

171
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,810
I beg your pardon.
The door was open.

172
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,350
It's an honor to see you again.

173
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,310
The honor is all mine,
Viscount Morcerf.

174
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,720
Please, call me Albert.

175
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,690
Surely you and I are on familiar terms by now, Count.

176
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,620
And now, as promised, allow me to introduce you to my friends.

177
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,400
You already know Franz.

178
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,900
This is Lucien Debray.

179
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,500
He is a shrewd civil servant, who already holds a key position in the Interior Ministry in spite of his young age.

180
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,770
This is Beauchamp.
He's a newspaper reporter.

181
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,040
He can tell you anything you might want to know about Paris.

182
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,050
Admittedly, it's more of a third-rate gossip sheet than a newspaper.

183
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,210
Most fascinating.

184
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,150
Cavalry Captain Maximilien Morrel, hero of the Eridanus campaign.

185
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,950
Nice to meet you.

186
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,820
Ah, the very paragon of a
faithful, brave soldier, I see.

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,590
You know the Captain?

188
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,930
Not at all.

189
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,930
We've heard that you've come to us from somewhere far away.

190
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,910
You're trying to interview him already?
Don't be rude to our guest.

191
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,030
I'm just doing my job.

192
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,010
On many worlds, photographs are seen as an abominable custom.

193
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,320
I must ask you to abstain.

194
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,180
Sorry, sorry...

195
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,650
In the course of visiting many
foreign lands as a sailor,

196
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,420
...l've become thoroughly tainted by the customs of other worlds.

197
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,590
I must seem quite the savage to the people of Paris.

198
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,130
What sorts of places have you been to?

199
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,700
I have traveled to many places.

200
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,580
To Eastern Space. To Northern Space.
Even to the core of the galaxy.

201
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,340
Even the lmperium?

202
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,580
Of course. To a sailor, there
are no such things as borders.

203
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,780
Could that not be considered treason against the state?

204
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,720
I see no reason to swear loyalty to people who do nothing to protect me.

205
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,820
Do you not agree?

206
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,690
I see you possess rather bold opinions.

207
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,700
True enough.

208
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,900
I suggest that you experience being cast out into the vast universe all alone.

209
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,270
I expect that you will soon understand that the only person one can count upon is oneself.

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,510
Set the table for tea at once.

211
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,850
And where do you hail from?

212
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,050
I came into this world in a land
that is beyond your imagination.

213
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,260
A place that you'd rather not mention?

214
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,330
Franz!
Don't be rude!

215
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,000
If we're going to be associating as friends, shouldn't we at least know that much?

216
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,470
That is quite understandable.

217
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,040
The reason that distinguished gentlemen such as yourselves are interested in me...

218
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,970
...is because of the air of mystery surrounding me, is it not?

219
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,480
Were that not the case, surely a rustic aristocrat from the frontiers of space...

220
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,420
...would not have been given a seat at your table.

221
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,860
Well, you have us there.

222
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,330
But that's exactly why we want to know more about you, Count!

223
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,700
You're as naive as ever, I see.

224
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,700
Peppo!

225
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,170
Is something the matter?

226
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,230
Huh? Um, no.

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,460
All right, what are you up to?

228
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,660
You caught me.

229
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,600
I quit the bandit gang.

230
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,040
So I came here to Paris to look for work.

231
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,500
But what are you doing here?

232
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,310
I followed you here, Albert.

233
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,750
I'm lying, I'm lying!
It's just a coincidence.

234
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,760
There happened to be an opening here, that's all.

235
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,450
Tell me, Peppo...

236
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,680
So, you remembered my name.

237
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,150
Are you planning to stay here for good?

238
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,330
Can't I?

239
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,760
Well, it's, how can I put it?

240
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,790
Don't worry. Let's just agree to keep each other's secrets, okay?

241
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,000
Are you interested in learning that man's real identity?

242
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,070
Don't worry about it too much.
He's nobody special.

243
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,070
What do you want to do tonight?
Hit up Le Queen?

244
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,480
That's okay,
I'll pass.

245
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,140
As will I.

246
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,710
What the heck is this?

247
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,350
The Count of
Monte Cristo's voice...

248
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,030
What about it?

249
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,460
It isn't on the recording.

250
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,100
What sorts of places have you been to?

251
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,130
Even the lmperium?

252
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,690
Some might see...

253
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,240
It's probably a mechanical malfunction.

254
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,750
So, is this a malfunction, too?

255
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,260
What a beautiful woman.

256
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,460
T-That's my mother.

257
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,230
She is rather young.

258
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,310
This vista is that of Marseilles, is it not?

259
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,970
She likes paintings like this. I don't know why she chose that place as the setting.

260
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,070
It is magnificent.

261
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,670
Actually, my father hates this painting.

262
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,820
He was going to take it down and burn it, but we placated him by hanging it in my room.

263
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,450
Edmond...

264
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,530
Is there something about this painting?

265
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,400
No. I'm afraid that it is time that I took my leave of you.

266
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,100
Don't say that! Please, have dinner with us!

267
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,670
My mother and father are looking forward to meeting you, too.

268
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,010
If you're interested in paintings, my mother and father have many others in their collection.

269
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,050
My, what a stirring painting this is.

270
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,850
This is what my father likes.

271
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,820
The ones that my mother has collected are over here.

272
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,890
This must be your visitor.

273
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

274
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

275
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

276
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

277
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

278
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

279
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

280
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

281
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

282
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

283
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,760
My mother's past, which I never knew.

284
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,460
The men in her past.

285
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,430
Adults who live in the past.

286
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,500
Act 4:
A Mother's Secrets

287
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,300
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 4:

288
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,660
..."A Mother's Secrets".

289
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,930
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
