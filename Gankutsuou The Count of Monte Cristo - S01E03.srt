1
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,330
Friendship is something that is
both fascinating and beautiful.

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,540
"And yet" my friend said to me "there is
nothing so inconstant as the human heart."

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
{\pos(352350)}Act 3:
5/22 Stormy

5
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,770
Hey! Albert!

6
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,200
Wake up!

7
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,110
I can't believe you\nwere still in bed.

8
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,810
I have an important visitor coming today.
I've been really busy.

9
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,150
You didn't have to come\nif you don't want to.

10
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,550
Who's the visitor?

11
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,320
Someone who did me\na favor on Luna.

12
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,160
Oh that fake Count\nsomething-or-other.

13
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,520
Eugenie! That's going\ntoo far!

14
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,560
Speaking of visitors Renaud said\nthat he's bringing someone too.

15
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,200
What?

16
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,770
You know Albert you must be
the perfect target for a con artist.

17
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,910
She's losing her temper...

18
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,170
What are you angry about?

19
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,670
Who says I'm angry?
I'm just enjoying our drive.

20
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,340
This isn't a race.

21
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,970
Oh that's right. You love puttering around\nat a crawl with no destination in mind.

22
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,280
Both behind the wheel\nand in life.

23
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,020
My life is none\nof your business!

24
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,160
Get out.

25
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,450
Sure just watch me.
I don't want to ride with you anyway.

26
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,050
What are you talking about?
We're already here.

27
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,190
For the life of me I can't figure
out why you and I are engaged!

28
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,730
Then maybe you should ride\nin Debray's car on the way...

29
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh boy...

30
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,940
Hey would you\nbe careful?

31
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,800
Are you okay?

32
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,810
Yes.

33
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,010
Hey Albert!
Come take a look!

34
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,470
Hey!

35
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,990
Geez are women all you're good at
handling Mr. Bigshot private secretary?

36
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,290
Every dull drive needs a little\nstimulation doesn't it?

37
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,820
Next to me is a hack\nnewspaper reporter

38
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,290
...and in the back seat is a couple\nwho just got engaged!

39
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,410
That was amazing!

40
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,250
It was nothing. I was in a special\nforces unit in the army.

41
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,820
Muscle reinforcement processing huh?
I'd heard rumors about it...

42
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,780
Thank you for your\nassistance.

43
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,930
I-I'll get it myself.

44
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,210
Um... What is your name\nif I might ask?

45
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,510
It's Valentine.

46
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,580
I-I'm...

47
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,050
Hey Maximilien!
Sorry I'm late!

48
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,590
There I was out on recon and I\nstumbled into an enemy nest.

49
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,960
And when I accidentally dropped my
favorite grenade I went as pale as a ghost!

50
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,530
From inside the hole I could hear the
Erindanians making threatening clicking noises.

51
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,500
Anyway I don't subscribe to the theory\nthat they're a sentient race.

52
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,080
Would you like a piece?

53
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,680
In temperament they're\nvicious and cruel.

54
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,690
Thank you.

55
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,650
Well I don't want to go into detail\nwith these ladies present

56
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,650
...but just once they ought to round up\nthose human rights proponents...

57
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,860
It's delicious!

58
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,330
...and send 'em in there\nto have a nice chat with them!

59
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,120
You're a lucky man Franz!

60
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,420
Once you're married you'll be able\nto eat like this every day!

61
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,700
Um... Where was I?

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Oh right! Just then I thought
I was done for!

63
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,200
And who do you suppose\nshowed up then?

64
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,440
None other than Space Cavalry
Captain Maximilien Morrel

65
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,850
...the man I owe\nmy life to!

66
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,680
You're quite a man to look after a klutz\nwho stumbled his way onto a battlefield.

67
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Where do you\nhail from?

68
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,060
My family is\nfrom Marseilles.

69
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,030
That's a rough place.

70
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,690
And you?

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,130
Paris of course!
Admittedly from the old part of town.

72
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,140
Marseilles... What sort\nof place is it?

73
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,600
When I was young it was\na beautiful harbor town.

74
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,040
At any rate it's not a place that\na young lady should venture into.

75
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,640
We haven't climbed up here\nin a long time.

76
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,270
What a great breeze.

77
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,540
Those clouds look a bit\nmenacing though.

78
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,410
Something interesting\ncatch your eye?

79
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,070
Why do you suppose there's a need\nto divide the world with city walls?

80
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,350
The ugliness of the outside world\nexists for the express purpose...

81
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,920
...of making the beauty of our
kingdom stand out all the more.

82
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,690
Maybe but there's plenty of great\nthings outside the walls.

83
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Don't you think we should\nopen our eyes a little more?

84
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,730
Oh have you grown up a little\nfrom going on your trip?

85
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,230
I suppose you're right.

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,530
So go ahead and take on all the troubles\nthat exist outside the walls.

87
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,400
That should quiet those pangs
of boredom of yours a little.

88
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
That is what we should\nbe looking at.

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,710
The High Court of Justice.
Danglars Bank.

90
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,250
And the place your father works at
Space Forces lmperial Headquarters.

91
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,350
The triangle of power.

92
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,920
That is the true "great thing" that\nwe should inherit don't you think?

93
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,270
To me it feels like we're the ones\nwho have been sealed in.

94
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,910
I am now no longer alone\nin my solitude.

95
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,630
For I am now surrounded by the Furies\nthe goddesses of vengeance.

96
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,620
In the darkness
I awaited the dawn.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,740
And once dawn came I cursed my flesh\nuntil night fell once more.

98
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,540
I even prayed that I would\nlose my sanity.

99
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,110
But those prayers\nwent unheeded.

100
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:18,050
I even strove for death but the Devil's\ncold pitiless hand held me back.

101
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,090
Soon...
It won't be long now...

102
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,740
Boy what a lousy\ndrive that was...

103
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,840
Maybe it was punishment for
skipping the Cabinet meeting...

104
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,370
Have the candidates for the next
President been chosen yet?

105
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,220
The word on the street is that
His Excellency Morcerf is the front runner.

106
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,420
You've heard a few things from\nyour father right Albert?

107
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,220
Maximilien you should watch\nyour step around Beauchamp.

108
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,220
He's a terrible man who will use even\nhis friends' scandals as fodder for articles

109
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,730
...and he won't think twice\nabout it.

110
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,330
That's what they call
"impartial journalism."

111
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,660
I read your articles\nall the time.

112
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,330
But I do not approve\nof the content.

113
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,500
I get that\nall the time.

114
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
Where are the ladies?

115
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,110
They went home saying something\nabout their dresses being soaked.

116
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,040
Renaud's antique too.

117
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,550
If they'd said something I would\nhave given them a lift home.

118
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,190
That'd be like tossing food\nto a monkey.

119
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,980
So the Count of
Monte Cristo huh?

120
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,190
I can't say that the name\nis familiar.

121
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,420
There's no documents on him\nat the Cabinet Secretariat either.

122
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,220
It's probably an alias.
Or maybe...

123
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,330
A pretender or\na con man huh?

124
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,300
I'll thank you to stop engaging in idle gossip
about an honored guest of the Morcerf home.

125
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,970
Where'd you say that you ran into this
"honored guest" of yours again?

126
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,000
At Luna's Carnival\nthis past spring.

127
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,710
Apparently the honored son of the\nfamily was abducted by bandits.

128
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,480
That's too funny. Were you seduced\nby one of Luna's wily vixens?

129
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,750
Damn it...

130
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,130
And that's when the Count rescued me\nfrom their clutches.

131
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,210
I guess you owe him\nyour life then.

132
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,810
It's clear that he's incredibly
wealthy as well as very kind.

133
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,040
And would you say that this millionaire's\nmoney pouch was stuffed full of forged bills?

134
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,380
Look at this!

135
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,860
If he wasn't of noble birth would he\nhave a watch as beautiful as this?

136
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,900
Con artists use trinkets like that\nall the time to win people's trust.

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
He's no con artist!

138
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,900
He commands a\nhuge spaceship

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,990
...he travels with aliens and a woman of\nunmatched beauty from Eastern Space

140
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,740
...he's free from the rule\nof any government

141
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,140
...and he mingles freely\nwith people of all classes.

142
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,450
In everything he does\nhe breaks with tradition.

143
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,040
And then\nonce night falls

144
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,820
...he wanders the darkness in search\nof the lifeblood of beautiful maidens.

145
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,850
I wouldn't be surprised\nif he did.

146
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,090
The Count has a ruthless side that
doesn't care about human life at all.

147
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,290
Franz!

148
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,970
Calm down Albert!

149
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,640
You know there was a case of a sailor who\ncontracted a local disease on some planet

150
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,680
...and went around sucking all the\nblood he could find wasn't there?

151
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,290
You should be careful\ntoo Albert.

152
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,220
I hear they prefer the blood\nof virgin girls and boys.

153
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,620
You think he's a vampire or something?
That's ridiculous.

154
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,790
It's a lot more plausible\nthan Lunar bandits.

155
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,190
Or kindhearted\nrich people.

156
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,340
His Excellency the Count\nof Monte Cristo.

157
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,600
Show him in\nat once.

158
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,910
I beg your pardon.
The door was open.

159
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,450
It's an honor to\nsee you again.

160
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,410
The honor is all mine
Viscount Morcerf.

161
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,820
Please call me Albert.

162
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,790
Surely you and I are on familiar\nterms by now Count.

163
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,720
And now as promised allow me\nto introduce you to my friends.

164
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,500
You already know Franz.

165
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,000
This is Lucien Debray.

166
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,570
He is a shrewd civil servant who already holds\na key position in the Interior Ministry...

167
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,170
...in spite of his\nyoung age.

168
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,870
This is Beauchamp.
He's a newspaper reporter.

169
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,140
He can tell you anything you\nmight want to know about Paris.

170
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,150
Admittedly it's more of a third-rate\ngossip sheet than a newspaper.

171
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,310
Most fascinating.

172
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,250
Cavalry Captain Maximilien Morrel\nhero of the Eridanus campaign.

173
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,050
Nice to meet you.

174
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,920
Ah the very paragon of a
faithful brave soldier I see.

175
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,690
You know the Captain?

176
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,030
Not at all.

177
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,030
We've heard that you've come to us\nfrom somewhere far away.

178
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,900
You're trying to interview him already?
Don't be rude to our guest.

179
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,130
I'm just doing\nmy job.

180
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,110
On many worlds photographs are\nseen as an abominable custom.

181
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,420
I must ask you\nto abstain.

182
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,280
Sorry sorry...

183
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,750
In the course of visiting many
foreign lands as a sailor

184
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,520
...l've become thoroughly tainted\nby the customs of other worlds.

185
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,690
I must seem quite the savage\nto the people of Paris.

186
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,230
What sorts of places\nhave you been to?

187
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,800
I have traveled\nto many places.

188
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,680
To Eastern Space. To Northern Space.
Even to the core of the galaxy.

189
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,440
Even the lmperium?

190
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,680
Of course. To a sailor there
are no such things as borders.

191
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,880
Could that not be considered\ntreason against the state?

192
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,820
I see no reason to swear loyalty to people\nwho do nothing to protect me.

193
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,920
Do you not agree?

194
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,790
I see you possess\nrather bold opinions.

195
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,800
True enough.

196
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,000
I suggest that you experience being cast out\ninto the vast universe all alone.

197
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,370
I expect that you will soon understand that the\nonly person one can count upon is oneself.

198
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,610
Set the table for tea\nat once.

199
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,950
And where do you\nhail from?

200
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,150
I came into this world in a land
that is beyond your imagination.

201
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,360
A place that you'd rather\nnot mention?

202
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,430
Franz!
Don't be rude!

203
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:17,100
If we're going to be associating as friends\nshouldn't we at least know that much?

204
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,570
That is quite understandable.

205
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,140
The reason that distinguished gentlemen\nsuch as yourselves are interested in me...

206
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,070
...is because of the air of mystery\nsurrounding me is it not?

207
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,580
Were that not the case surely a rustic\naristocrat from the frontiers of space...

208
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,520
...would not have been given\na seat at your table.

209
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,960
Well you have us there.

210
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,430
But that's exactly why we want\nto know more about you Count!

211
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,800
You're as naive as ever I see.

212
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,800
Peppo!

213
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,270
Is something\nthe matter?

214
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,330
Huh? Um no.

215
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,560
All right what are you\nup to?

216
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,760
You caught me.

217
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,700
I quit the bandit gang.

218
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,140
So I came here to Paris\nto look for work.

219
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,600
But what are you\ndoing here?

220
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,410
I followed you here Albert.

221
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,850
I'm lying I'm lying!
It's just a coincidence.

222
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,610
There happened to be an\nopening here that's all.

223
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,550
Tell me Peppo...

224
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,780
So you remembered\nmy name.

225
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,250
Are you planning to\nstay here for good?

226
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,430
Can't I?

227
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,860
Well it's\nhow can I put it?

228
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,890
Don't worry. Let's just agree to\nkeep each other's secrets okay?

229
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,100
Are you interested in learning\nthat man's real identity?

230
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,170
Don't worry about it too much.
He's nobody special.

231
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,170
What do you want to do tonight?
Hit up Le Queen?

232
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,580
That's okay
I'll pass.

233
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,240
As will I.

234
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,810
What the heck\nis this?

235
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,450
The Count of
Monte Cristo's voice...

236
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,130
What about it?

237
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,560
It isn't on the recording.

238
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
What sorts of places\nhave you been to?

239
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,230
Even the lmperium?

240
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,790
Some might see...

241
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,340
It's probably a\nmechanical malfunction.

242
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,850
So is this a\nmalfunction too?

243
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,360
What a beautiful woman.

244
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,560
T-That's my mother.

245
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,330
She is rather young.

246
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,410
This vista is that of Marseilles\nis it not?

247
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,070
She likes paintings like this. I don't know\nwhy she chose that place as the setting.

248
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,170
It is magnificent.

249
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,770
Actually my father hates\nthis painting.

250
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,920
He was going to take it down and burn it but\nwe placated him by hanging it in my room.

251
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,820
Edmond...

252
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
Is there something\nabout this painting?

253
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,500
No. I'm afraid that it is time\nthat I took my leave of you.

254
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,200
Don't say that! Please\nhave dinner with us!

255
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,770
My mother and father are looking forward\nto meeting you too.

256
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,110
If you're interested in paintings my mother and\nfather have many others in their collection.

257
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,150
My what a stirring\npainting this is.

258
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,950
This is what\nmy father likes.

259
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,920
The ones that my mother has collected\nare over here.

260
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,990
This must be\nyour visitor.

261
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,860
My mother's past\nwhich I never knew.

262
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,560
The men\nin her past.

263
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,530
Adults who live\nin the past.

264
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,460
{\pos(352350)}Act 4:
