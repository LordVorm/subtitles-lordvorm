1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,790
Albert!

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,720
Albert!

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,130
This isn't over yet!

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,670
Eat this!

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,870
Albert!

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,410
Father...

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,930
The Count of Monte Cristo

8
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,990
I bid you welcome to my palace!

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,560
You!

10
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,220
Edmond?

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,550
W-Where'd you go?!
Where are you?!

12
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,320
Show yourself!

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,440
Fernand Mondego!

14
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,510
Allow me to express my sincerest gratitude for attacking in person, my good former General.

15
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,510
Vile apparition!

16
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,210
Those words will be the last you ever speak!

17
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,490
I will give you the despair of one who has had everything stolen from him.

18
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,670
Prepare to taste the depths of my vengeance!

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,910
Act 23:
Edmond Dantes

20
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,970
Don't push yourself too hard.

21
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,780
Where's Mother?!

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,050
We managed to pull her back from the brink.
We're keeping her doped up for now.

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,550
Baptistin! Can this ship still fly?!

24
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,090
Yeah, barely.

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,030
Hurry, take us to the
Champs Elysées!

26
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,060
My father wants to kill the Count!

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,170
Lifting off immediately.
Setting course for the Count's manor!

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,490
Baptistin, you've got things covered down there, right?

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,800
You bet! Do your thing, big guy!

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,460
Count!

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,070
Hurry! You must take your medicine!

32
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,070
That will not... be necessary, Haidee.

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,810
My pact with Gankutsuou is inviolate.

34
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,020
My body is no longer my own.

35
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,420
No, Count! You are yourself!

36
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,260
You are the only person in this world that I adore.

37
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,400
Your words... no longer reach me.

38
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,540
My only desire is to carry out my final revenge.

39
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,630
I will not allow you to die.

40
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,930
Not like my father did... Never!

41
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,960
Damn you!

42
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,950
Set your mind at ease.

43
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
I will not kill you.

44
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,370
I will not give you respite so easily!

45
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,000
You nightmare... begone!

46
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,350
H-How?
How can this be?!

47
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,590
I will not die.

48
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,730
I am not even permitted death.

49
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,430
S-Stay away!
Stay away from me!

50
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,070
Fernand... Look upon me.

51
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,310
Look upon the man who has sacrificed himself, body and soul, for the sake of his revenge!

52
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,090
You mustn't!

53
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,490
You mustn't go any further!

54
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,700
I cannot allow you to take this any further.

55
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,400
Stand aside.

56
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,540
I will not.

57
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,470
Stand aside!

58
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,940
I will not!

59
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,810
Because I... I love you.

60
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,790
I do not want to lose the one I love like I did that day.

61
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,030
Even if I must forfeit my life here!

62
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,190
You heard her, Edmond.

63
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,930
Her Highness says that she will sacrifice her life for you.

64
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,270
Hey!

65
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,580
Father!

66
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,710
Father! Stop!

67
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,420
Don't do it!

68
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,490
Drop that sword right now, you hear?
If you don't, she's dead!

69
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,120
Count, please... Your medicine!

70
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,160
You and your "revenge"!
You and your "judgment"!

71
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,440
This is why you've always been a hopeless weakling!

72
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,980
Highness, you got a little too carried away.

73
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,150
Shall I have you pay the price for that right here and now?

74
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,990
Fernand. I suggest you look to your son.

75
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,470
You bastard!

76
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,980
Your son's life is mine for the taking.

77
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,510
Bertuccio. Pull the trigger.

78
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,780
Have you gone crazy?!

79
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,190
Go ahead, I dare you to touch that trigger!

80
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,560
She'll follow right on his heels!

81
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,960
Stop it! Don't do it, Father!

82
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Edmond! Give it up!

83
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,710
Don't try to pretend to be tough!
You're too easygoing for that!

84
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,100
Let go of my son!

85
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,640
Bertuccio, don't do this! Don't you care what happens to her?!

86
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,880
The man... The man I serve is...

87
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,560
Father... Don't hurt anyone but me.

88
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,930
Please, don't hurt her any more...

89
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,830
Edmond! Please, let my son go!

90
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,280
He's the only thing I have left that's precious to me.

91
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,070
Please, don't take him from me!

92
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,680
Hate me!

93
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,950
Hate ME!

94
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,250
I'll give you my life if that's what you want!
But please, don't take his.

95
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,260
I'm begging you, Edmond!
Anything but my son's life!

96
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,390
Kill me! Kill me!

97
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,830
Fernand...

98
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,870
I'm so sorry.

99
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,770
Death is the ultimate end of all things.

100
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,380
But in the end, it is nothing but a release from suffering.

101
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,920
What I want from you is despair.

102
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,720
I want your everlasting despair.

103
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,890
It is time.

104
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,130
No! Don't!

105
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,320
Baptistin!

106
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,560
What am I doing on the ground?

107
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,640
Baptistin! Why did you do that?

108
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,840
No! I don't want you to die!

109
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,840
Quit your bawling... I'm just a little sleepy, that's all...

110
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,860
Count, what do you want so badly that you're willing to hurt innocent people to get it?!

111
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,290
And YOU! What the hell is so important that you'd even kill Mother and Haidee to get it?!

112
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,830
What's more important to you two than people's lives?!

113
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,030
No matter how much you try to justify it, murder is still murder!

114
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,470
Count, Father, all you two are doing is running away!

115
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,970
All you're doing is deluding yourselves by refusing to back down to each other!

116
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,770
You claim to understand what my friend feels inside?

117
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,110
You think that you understand my poor friend's feelings?

118
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,420
Well, I...

119
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,820
The pact is concluded.

120
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,930
No!

121
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,620
My name is...

122
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Gankutsuou.

123
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,440
Bertuccio! Fetch me my cloak!

124
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,300
Count! Is this the "destiny" you spoke of?!

125
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,910
Weren't you the one who told me that destiny was something...

126
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,580
...that you create for yourself with your own two hands?!

127
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,120
Where is your will now?

128
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,190
Where have you gone?

129
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,820
Count!

130
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,140
Count!

131
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,420
His time has run out.

132
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,550
You cannot save him.

133
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,250
Not you, a boy who does not understand my friend's heart.

134
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,020
I might not understand the Count's true feelings, but I...

135
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,170
Count?!

136
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,850
I'm... going to kill you!

137
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm going to...

138
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,060
Count!

139
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,320
Count!

140
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,260
Damn it!

141
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,830
No!

142
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,600
Count, no!

143
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,860
Count!

144
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,310
I cannot die...

145
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,940
Not until he dies at my hand...

146
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,850
Please, don't talk!

147
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,050
Where is he?
Where is Albert?!

148
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm... I'm right here!

149
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,590
Bring me my sword, Bertuccio...

150
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,330
Bring me my sword of vengeance... Put it in my hand...

151
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,330
I must kill him...

152
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,070
Count, I give you my word.

153
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,140
Even if the future is shrouded in darkness, and even if despair is raining down on me,

154
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,580
...I will go on living, no matter what!

155
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,810
Just as you did!

156
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,830
I want you to remember something for me...

157
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,840
My name is... Edmond Dantes.

158
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,580
Haidee.

159
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,880
I will not leave.

160
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,450
I will remain with the Count.

161
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,830
If you wish to flee, feel free to do so. But as for me, l...

162
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,730
Idiot! Do you really believe that the Count wants you to die?!

163
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,730
Didn't you hear him? He said, "I want you to remember my name".

164
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,370
Haidee, you have to live!

165
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,670
You have to leave this place and live!

166
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,420
Father, let's go!

167
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,330
I have always aspired to two things.

168
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,000
To be nobler than the nobility.

169
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,770
And to be a finer soldier than any other.

170
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:18,210
But in the end, it was an egotistical wish that glossed over the lies underneath.

171
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,510
Father!

172
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,010
There will be no more running away for me, Albert.

173
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,080
Now, go! Hurry!
Keep her safe!

174
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,660
Hurry!

175
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,070
Run. Keep running!
Ever forward.

176
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,970
Edmond...

177
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,210
Albert!

178
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,780
Jump!

179
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,550
Excuse me.

180
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,840
Shout out my name.

181
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,550
Seek out my soul.

182
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,660
My name is Gankutsuou!

183
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,260
And I am always with you.

184
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,710
I'm not the man I used to be

185
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:26,430
And what you see is not what it seems

186
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:33,020
I traveled through space to be with you here

187
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,650
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

188
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,870
You won't see me coming...

189
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,380
You won't see me coming...

190
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,380
Till I strike

191
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,270
You won't see me coming...

192
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,780
You won't see me coming...

193
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,910
Till I strike

194
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,010
Final Act:
At the Shore
