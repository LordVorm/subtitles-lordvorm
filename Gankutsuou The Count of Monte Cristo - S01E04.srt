1
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen\ngood evening.

3
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,940
...my friend and I arrived in Paris\nwhere the boy awaited us.

4
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,910
I tremble in silence at these\nemotions which leak out...

5
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,940
...as the hour of reunion\ndraws near.

6
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,150
This must be\nyour guest.

7
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,170
Count if you don't mind I'd like you to join us\nfor dinner after you've met my parents.

8
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,550
Count?

9
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,820
If it is not\ntoo much trouble.

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,330
Please do. After all we owe you\nour son's life.

11
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,830
Welcome to our home
my good Count of Monte Cristo.

12
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,060
{\pos(352350)}Act 4:
A Mother's Secrets

13
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,590
To our new friend the
Count of Monte Cristo.

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,190
Oh is that so?

15
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,990
I'm embarrassed that you
know of the Janina campaign.

16
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,830
The people praise me\nas a hero

17
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,670
...but to a soldier such\nthings mean little.

18
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,810
After all nothing good ever\nresults from destruction.

19
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,540
No these idyllic times in which we live\nwere built on the back of sacrifice.

20
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,410
Such is my opinion\nat any rate.

21
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,990
I expect that the far corners\nof the galaxy are echoing...

22
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,210
...with the name of
General Morcerf by now.

23
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,690
You honor me\nby saying so.

24
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh dear the food wasn't\nto your liking?

25
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,740
Not at all. Please think\nnothing of it.

26
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,240
I am in the habit\nof eating very little.

27
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,180
I can't say that I don't\nunderstand how you feel.

28
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,890
Having advanced in years I find myself
weary of extravagant meals such as this.

29
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,760
In my case I find lately\nthat I seldom sleep either.

30
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,460
I'm amazed that you've managed\nto stay healthy.

31
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,700
It is because\nof these.

32
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,370
Are they some sort\nof space rations?

33
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,540
In the course of wandering the\nsea of stars for so long

34
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,150
...my body and soul have changed\nbeyond recognition.

35
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,470
Even so I hope that you
would at least eat something...

36
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,250
The thought of neither sleeping\nnor eating is too sad to bear.

37
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,820
Too sad to bear?

38
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,460
Very well then.

39
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,500
In that case perhaps
I shall sample this.

40
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,000
Please do.

41
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,780
This taste brings\nback memories...

42
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,380
Brings back memories?

43
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,580
I once experienced delightful cooking\nsuch as this in the south of France.

44
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,420
This is the dish that you've made for as\nlong as I can remember right Mother?

45
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,260
Yes.

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,760
By any chance you wouldn't happen\nto be from Marseilles would you?

47
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,930
No.

48
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,700
My wife has nothing to do
with such a barbaric province.

49
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,930
Isn't that right
Mercedes?

50
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,700
Y-Yes...

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,670
Oh really?

52
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,270
What's the matter?

53
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,550
One of my friends\nis from there.

54
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,580
His name is Maximilien Morrel.
He's a really nice person.

55
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,010
Morrel...

56
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,490
Forgive me if I misspoke.
Please do not take offense.

57
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,760
That's all right.

58
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,730
Our family traces its roots back\nto a powerful Catalan family.

59
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,360
This soup has been a specialty of my
wife's ever since she was a young girl.

60
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,300
Oh I see. So you and the Countess\nwere childhood friends then?

61
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,570
Yes that's right.

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,910
Which explains why you seem so close.
I am jealous beyond words.

63
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,240
I had no idea that a man like you could\nbe jealous of anyone Count.

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,790
Yes of course.

65
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,580
If that person is a man\nof your father's caliber.

66
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,090
Get the Count something to drink.
His glass is empty.

67
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,060
Please stay for as long\nas time permits.

68
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,440
Sitting around the table like this it almost\nfeels as if you are a member of the family.

69
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,520
What a maddening scent\nthis is...

70
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,050
Count?

71
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,520
It is from the\nmuscat grapes.

72
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,560
Are you fatigued?

73
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:08,360
No please forgive me for\nforcing you to eat earlier.

74
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,540
Not at all. I had always hoped to
experience that delicious flavor again.

75
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,540
It was a sublime\nexperience.

76
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,710
It was a simple\nrustic dish.

77
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,750
But it makes me happy\nto hear you say so.

78
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,880
Have you heard of this?
There is a saying that goes

79
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,950
"Those who share bread and salt under\nthe same roof become eternal friends."

80
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,300
That is a tradition handed down
in Eastern Space is it not?

81
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,330
Yes.

82
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,300
Which means that we are now friends.
For all eternity.

83
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,700
However this is not Eastern Space.
It is Paris.

84
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,910
In Paris everlasting friendship is impossible\nwithout the act of sharing bread and salt.

85
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,050
Your soup truly\nwas delicious.

86
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,450
Warm and yet evocative\nof past memories.

87
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,290
It is something\nwhich gives comfort.

88
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,620
Like a breeze blowing across\nthe Mediterranean Sea.

89
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,930
Count are you very familiar\nwith Marseilles?

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,900
I could say that
I am aware of it.

91
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,310
But perhaps I never truly\nknew it at all.

92
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,070
Infidelity. Adultery.
Dalliances in the dead of night.

93
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,410
You aristocrats are as energetic\nas the rumors say.

94
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,210
Spare me your\ncrude comments!

95
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,250
The Count is a friend\nof mine.

96
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Honestly you're such\na child.

97
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,420
If people could become friends simply\nby sharing bread and salt

98
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,720
...life would be simpler.

99
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,090
What are you\ntalking about?

100
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,060
You'll understand sooner\nor later little boy.

101
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,740
I am most grateful to you for allowing me\nto experience a day such as today.

102
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,180
Not at all. I'm proud that I had the
opportunity to introduce you to my parents.

103
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,710
To introduce a\nman I admire.

104
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,220
What say you?

105
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,160
I would like to invite you to my residence\non the Champs-Elysees in the near future.

106
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
I'd love to come!

107
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,490
The Count of Monte Cristo was a
mysterious man don't you think?

108
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,500
Yes. There was a sternness somewhere\nin him that keeps people at arm's length.

109
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,600
That just means that compared to the Count\nthe people of Paris are dull.

110
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,510
My...

111
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,740
You might not know this Mother but\nthere's more to the world than Paris.

112
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,180
Out beyond the walls there's a world\nthat's endlessly captivating.

113
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,050
I think you've changed\nsince your journey to Luna.

114
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,250
My journey is\njust beginning.

115
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,590
Don't go to worlds too far\nremoved from our own.

116
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,660
You should exercise moderation\nin your association with the Count.

117
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,260
Oh please Mother...
You sound just like Franz.

118
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,870
Well even though he seems\nmore than a little shady

119
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,840
...having the Morcerf family establish ties with\na man like him might not be a bad thing.

120
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,740
Not when this family is about to
throw its hat into the political arena.

121
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,050
Good grief why do aristocrats
eat like this all the time?

122
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,380
Dinner parties high tea\nballs...

123
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,150
It's probably because they
don't have anything else to do.

124
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,750
In other words if you took away\nthe gluttony lust and avarice

125
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,160
...there wouldn't be\nanything left.

126
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
You need to watch\nyour mouth.

127
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:29,130
Didn't you think that their guest today\nwas rather elegant and handsome?

128
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm not so sure.
He wasn't very refined.

129
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,340
Maybe but he had a pretty good vibe going\nwith the mistress under the grapevine trellis.

130
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,920
What really? I'd always thought that the master\nwas the only man in the world for the mistress.

131
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,580
I think that any society lady would fall for\nthat Count if he worked his mojo on her.

132
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,550
Give it a rest already!

133
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,990
That was definitely the face\nof a woman in love.

134
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,230
If you don't stop that
I'm going to report you.

135
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,730
Oo I'm so scared...

136
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,930
That's preposterous. Mother is the last person\nin the world who would be capable of...

137
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,210
Mother?

138
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,490
Who's in that picture\nshe's looking at?

139
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,190
Do you find me\na horrible man?

140
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,960
No. I will stay at your side\nfor as long as I live.

141
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,530
Even if that means walking down\nthe path to ruin.

142
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,200
It is not we\nwho will be ruined.

143
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,000
I have come home
Father.

144
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,110
What you're still here?

145
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,880
Hey don't touch those!

146
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,460
I hate to break it to you but I've gotten\ninto your father's good graces

147
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,750
...so I'll be staying here\nfor a while.

148
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,220
His "good graces"?

149
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,960
It means that your father\nis a man like any other.

150
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,430
Give those bad jokes\na rest.

151
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,530
Well setting aside your\nfather for the moment

152
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,970
...the one that I'd be worried about\nis your mother you know?

153
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,740
What's that supposed\nto mean?

154
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,950
I mean she was staring so wistfully\nat that picture of a young man...

155
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,900
You saw that?

156
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,210
It was definitely\na picture of a man.

157
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,520
A man who wasn't\nyour father.

158
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh I can understand.

159
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,080
If my mother was staring at a\npicture of some strange man

160
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,630
...l'd be depressed too.

161
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,130
That's about enough!
Get out!

162
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,490
Yes sir!

163
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,150
Eugenie? I didn't know\nyou were here.

164
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,280
Ever the late riser
I see.

165
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,510
Why are you dressed\nlike that?

166
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,310
What's wrong\nwith it?

167
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,650
Skirts just don't work\non you.

168
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,150
I didn't come here\nto see you Albert!

169
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,650
Then don't have me dragged\nout of bed!

170
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm the one who had you\nwoken up Albert.

171
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,960
Is something\nthe matter?

172
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,970
No ma'am.

173
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,500
Eugenie is your fiancee\nisn't she?

174
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,340
I think it's only natural that you\nshould greet her when she's over.

175
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,280
Sure I suppose.
Um are you going somewhere?

176
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,650
Oh we're just going out to do\na little shopping together.

177
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,650
Let's go Madame!

178
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,820
Of course.

179
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,020
That reminds me. What's this I hear about the
Count of Monte Cristo inviting you over?

180
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,690
How did you\nknow that?

181
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,260
I heard about it\nfrom Franz.

182
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,790
He said that he and Maximilien\nwere also invited.

183
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,560
They were invited too?

184
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,780
What's he...

185
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
Peppo!
What are you doing?

186
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,150
Oh hi Albert!

187
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,330
Don't you "Oh hi!" me!
Don't play around with Mother's jewelry!

188
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,120
But they're so pretty!

189
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,600
If my father sees you like that
there'll be hell to pay!

190
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,800
Fine fine.
I'll put them back then.

191
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,710
You're dying to know
what's in there aren't you?

192
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,050
It's like your mother's secret
treasure is hidden inside.

193
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,820
Impossible.

194
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,120
Oh there's no such thing as a human being\nwho doesn't have secrets.

195
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,830
Just like you and I share\na certain secret night.

196
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,500
That only happened because
I was tricked by you!

197
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,490
If you ever want that lock opened\ncome tell me anytime.

198
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,100
I specialize in getting\ninto people's drawers.

199
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,800
Stop being crude\nand get back to work!

200
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,400
Oh. Fine.

201
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,890
It can't be...

202
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,420
Why would Mother have\na picture of the Count?

203
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,140
This is ridiculous.
What am I so worried about?

204
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,380
His Excellency General Morcerf!
Ten-hut!

205
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,170
All high and mighty...

206
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,680
How do I look?
Not too strange I hope?

207
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,810
It looks wonderful\non you.

208
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,150
What?

209
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,350
Thank goodness.
You're more upbeat than I expected.

210
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,860
Gee thanks.

211
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,600
For a visit to the Count's place that outfit isn't\nquite flamboyant enough don't you think?

212
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,100
Not flamboyant enough?

213
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,570
Albert? What in the world\nare you wearing?

214
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,740
What's wrong\nwith it?

215
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,180
Where do I\neven begin?

216
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,580
I'll never understand the ways\nof you aristocrats.

217
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,710
Why are you dressed\nlike a pirate?!

218
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,150
Uh what are you even\ndoing here Beauchamp?

219
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,960
You don't expect me to miss my chance to\nget photos of the Count's mansion do you?

220
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,270
Oh brother. And here I had hoped to go\nthere by myself if at all possible.

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,940
That day when I first met you you made me\nrealize that there is always hope

222
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,670
...regardless of the circumstances\nyou might find yourself in.

223
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,970
I will never forget\nthat lesson.

224
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,480
Hope...

225
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,820
When I was flung out of the Chateau d'lf\ninto the black void of space

226
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,060
...hope was the one thing\nthat I had in my possession.

227
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,900
You're sure\nthis is it?

228
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,470
Yep. number thirty Champs-Elysees.
No doubt about it.

229
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,450
It's a lot more austere than I expected\nit to be considering the Count.

230
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,860
I was expecting the sort of place that would\ndrive a commoner into a rage if he saw it.

231
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,740
Welcome messieurs.
We have been expecting you.

232
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,700
Early Rococo huh?
And not Revival either.

233
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,010
Isn't this amazing?

234
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,210
Well it's a bit too far removed\nfrom my world...

235
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,910
Please pardon the delay.
Allow me to show you to the Count.

236
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,860
What the...?

237
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,220
We're going down!

238
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,420
Baptistin where are\nwe going?

239
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,310
We've stopped!

240
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,010
Welcome messieurs.
The Count awaits.

241
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,020
That's...

242
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,970
Even the floor and columns are gold...
The man has expensive tastes.

243
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,540
Where could he have gotten\nthis much gold?

244
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,870
That's why I think there's\nsomething fishy about him.

245
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,990
At this rate I bet his bed and
pillows are gonna be solid gold too.

246
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,190
I'd never be able to fall asleep\nwith all this glare.

247
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,480
Hey! Look at that!

248
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,360
That's...

249
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,900
The sea?

250
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,890
No wait.
Look at that sky!

251
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,720
It's artificial?

252
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
I can't believe it...

253
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,440
This alone would make\none hell of a story.

254
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,410
This is so beautiful...

255
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,710
Wait I know\nthis view!

256
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,450
That look suits you quite well\nSir Pirate.

257
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,790
Count!

258
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,520
Wha...?

259
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,470
If you don't mind I would like
you to have this Sir Pirate.

260
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,650
I was given this blade by a\ncertain ship's navigator.

261
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,660
Perhaps it will serve to protect you\nas well as to carve a path for you.

262
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,360
When we meet someone

263
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,930
...the selfless considerate part of us\nclashes with the selfish love of our emotions.

264
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,610
Next time on Gankutsuou
The Count of Monte Cristo act 5

265
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,580
{\pos(352350)}Act 5:
Do You Love Your Fiancee?

266
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,970
..."Do You Love Your Fiancee?"

267
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,280
Bide your time\nand hold out hope!
