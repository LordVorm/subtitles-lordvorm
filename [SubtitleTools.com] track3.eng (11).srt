1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,190
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,160
Wishing to express his feelings,

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,790
...the young man ran to the opera house,

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,370
...where his former fiancée awaited him.

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,830
However, he is not yet aware.

23
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,290
Not yet aware of his father's sordid past,

24
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,920
...which lies concealed behind the broken engagement.

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Act 13:
Haidee

26
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,720
That man is a murderer!

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,100
I am surprised to see you come all this way, Your Honor. Is this spectacle being provided as a sideshow to the opera?

28
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,170
I take it that you recognize this?

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,070
As I recall, that is the ring that I gave to your wife.

30
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,440
It had poison hidden inside.

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,050
Goodness, what a fascinating contraption.

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,480
It would appear that you were trying to kill even my wife.

33
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,720
Surely you jest.
Why would I do such a thing?

34
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,230
It's obvious!

35
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,960
Isn't this a simple case of that barbaric custom from Eastern Space known as the "thrill kill"?

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,360
The Count would never do such a thing!

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,060
You're being deceived by that man.

38
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,970
The Count was the one who told us about the threat to Valentine's life!

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,910
Even a foreigner such as myself can expect to receive a proper trial, I take it?

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,210
Of course. By law, you will receive an impartial trial.

41
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,690
Hearing that sets my mind at ease.
I have a witness to offer in my defense.

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,790
What?

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,000
Someone who knows the whole truth.

44
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,230
Heloise?!

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,900
I have heard many fascinating things from Madame and your son.

46
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,040
Including things which touch upon certain family affairs.

47
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,740
Why, you!

48
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,010
What would you like to do?
Will you arrest me?

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,650
What's the deal?

50
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,420
I thought they were gonna arrest him.

51
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,290
Not to worry, gentlemen.

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,650
It would seem that His Honor the
Crown Prosecutor made a mistake.

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
Way to go, Count!

54
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,380
It's nice to see that hanging judge get some egg on his face!

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
It would be best for you to return to your home.

56
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,600
But l...

57
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,440
You needn't worry about me.

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,380
Don't think for an instant that this is over!

59
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,390
Monsieur Villefort...

60
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,680
That man wants to ruin me.

61
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,220
I can't believe it! You're still saying that nonsense?

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,420
I can sense it. I can feel an evil presence in that man's soul.

63
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,040
You're still worrying about your former fiancée?

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,070
Marquis Cavalcanti.

65
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,410
By all means, please call me Andrea.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
I don't know what my father said to you,

67
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,780
...but I don't feel the least bit grateful to you, is that clear?

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,190
Now, now...

69
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,450
It's always been my dream to play at the opera house,

70
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,260
...but using money to make it come true was...

71
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,430
It was your own merit that won you the right to that concert.

72
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,870
The reason, of course, is that your talent has transformed me into your humble servant.

73
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,630
He left you there.

74
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,840
It would seem that he doesn't even have the courage to try to steal you away.

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,220
It's not here, huh?

76
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,460
There were no records matching the requested term in any of the volumes owned by this library.

77
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,600
I see.

78
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,400
The Royal Library prides itself on being the greatest repository of data in the universe.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,190
It's hard to believe that there could be a word that isn't registered here.

80
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,160
It's possible that the word is on the General
Security Directorate's banned list.

81
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,130
What do you mean?

82
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,410
Regulations are in place that prohibit general readers...

83
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,380
...from browsing classified topics.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,340
What do you MEAN, you're cutting off my financial support?!

85
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,020
I've had a few sudden expenses.

86
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,510
What am I supposed to do about the presidential election?!

87
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,090
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to cut you loose.

88
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,340
Me... And you...
And Villefort...

89
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,630
I thought it was our dream to climb hand in hand to the top of Paris!

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,810
Oh, was it?

91
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Why pull out when we're a single step away from making that dream a reality?!

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,020
My, um... analysts are telling me to quit gambling on you, General.

93
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,580
Is this about those letters from Edmond?

94
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,460
Now, now, I'm just saying that we all need to watch our step.

95
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,930
If you win the election,

96
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
...feel free to give me a call.

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,580
Excellency, we've established a comm channel with the Seventh Eastern Space Fleet.

98
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,280
That was a shameful display last night, don't you think?

99
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,810
What insolence!
Who are you?!

100
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,450
Lucien Debray, First Secretary.
I'm hurt that you don't remember me.

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,330
Ah, the spoiled rich boy in the Ministry of the Interior.

102
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,030
The Count of Monte Cristo is the talk of Paris at the moment.

103
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,130
You won't be able to arrest him without good cause.

104
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,070
He's plotting something,
I'm sure of it.

105
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,140
Can you prove it?

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,900
I'm the one who decides who is guilty or innocent.

107
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,430
The General Security Directorate is stepping in.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,010
They suspect that you're trying to file false charges against him.

109
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,880
You've gone a little too far this time.

110
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,420
It's probably only a matter of time before you're suspended from duty.

111
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,290
They can't!

112
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,090
Oh, here you are.

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,770
I need your advice on a certain matter.

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,490
It's rare for YOU to need anybody's advice on anything.

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,910
I had no choice but to beg an elite member of the Ministry of the Interior for help.

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,870
Your best friend isn't with you today?

117
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,850
Where's Victoria?

118
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,440
Madame is resting in her room.

119
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,490
I have no idea what to do with your mother.

120
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,920
She's been acting like this ever since she was out in the night air at the party in Auteuil and caught a cold.

121
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,800
So anyway, that's why I can't offer you a suitable welcome,

122
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,270
...but perhaps you'd care to join us for dinner?

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,730
I'd love to!

124
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,380
I have a little work to finish up, so my daughter will keep you company until I'm done.

125
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,370
Why don't you play another little tune?
For Andrea this time.

126
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,350
I would be honored if you did!
Oh, that reminds me...

127
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,360
Black hole futures?!

128
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,360
Now, then, let's get down to business, Michelle!

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
General Morcerf has called and made an appointment.

130
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,970
Never mind about that! Show me the ultra-high density materials market!

131
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,240
Get to it!

132
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,870
Understood.

133
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,510
Danglars has accessed the market.

134
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,640
Very well.
Sell.

135
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,910
Understood!

136
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,180
Let him eat his fill. We'll make sure that he's fattened up properly.

137
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,950
Wait until the time is right, and then leak intel that there are signs of an impending massive lmperial Forces offensive in the Central Galaxy.

138
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,630
Still, the thought of lining that vulture's pockets is a little distasteful.

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
"Gankutsuou", huh?

140
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,670
Are you ready to start?

141
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,730
Here we go.

142
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,980
Welcome to the Mansion of State Secrets.

143
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,140
What IS this place?

144
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,610
A database that's under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.

145
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,360
State search keyword.

146
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,000
Gankutsuou.

147
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,470
Lucien Debray, First Secretary, class S.
Access granted.

148
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,510
Where are we?!

149
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,240
Keep quiet.

150
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,010
Gankutsuou is the king of the shadows.

151
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,600
Which means what?

152
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,620
Nobody's ever seen what he looks like.
His name should never be spoken.

153
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,950
Those who break that taboo meet a fate worse than death.

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,460
Is that an urban legend?

155
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,860
It's the truth. He appeared on the fringes of the galaxy a thousand years ago...

156
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,430
...and tried to gain control of the criminal underworld.

157
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,910
He's an invader?

158
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,210
Gankutsuou is invincible. He controls people by manipulating their desires.

159
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,620
However, he was defeated by fate.

160
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,450
In June of the year 4002 of the Louis Philippe calendar,

161
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,780
...he was apprehended and incarcerated.

162
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,260
Incarcerated where?

163
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,290
We can't answer that.

164
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,790
Where was he imprisoned?

165
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,220
We can't answer that.

166
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,390
I hereby issue lmperial Edict 53!

167
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,130
Gankutsuou was imprisoned in the Chateau d'If.

168
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,240
What happened after that?

169
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,940
His death was confirmed on December 23, 5043.

170
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,670
Ten years ago?!

171
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,870
He was in prison for more than a thousand years?!

172
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,780
What was that prisoner's name?

173
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,890
The Man in the
Iron Mask.

174
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,180
What was his full name?!

175
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,690
Terminate access immediately.

176
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,990
Why?!

177
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,720
We can't answer that.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,690
I hereby issue special provision 3 of Edict 53!

179
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,930
His name...
His name was...

180
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,300
Illegal access!

181
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,330
Illegal access!

182
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,210
Enacting article 6, clause 2 of the Secrets Preservation Code.

183
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,460
T-This isn't good...

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,860
I want to know who Gankutsuou really is!

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,140
No, I HAVE to know!

186
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,940
Old man Noirtier might know.

187
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,570
Who, him?

188
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,680
A long time ago, he used to be top dog in the Ministry of the Interior.

189
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,650
But he also had a lot of enemies, and he was brought down.

190
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,040
You mean the assassination of the Prince?

191
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,760
He was a proponent of peace with the Empire.

192
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,740
Apparently, that's made it difficult for his son, Villefort, to move up in the world.

193
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,290
Of course, all that work has been for nothing now.

194
00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:00,870
Father... You must be laughing at me, a man who's lost both his status and his family.

195
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,310
You must think it's poetic justice for a man who's spent his career sending innocent men to prison and presiding over merciless trials.

196
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,420
That this is my punishment for defying your wishes and supporting war against the Empire...

197
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,990
...and for doing away with your compatriots.

198
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,730
I've worked hard to surpass you!

199
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,990
To surpass you, who had the power to sway government policy!
Do you have the slightest idea how hard that was?!

200
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,770
Any idea how hard it was to be your son in a world dominated by hawks?!

201
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,110
"Suspended from duty", huh?

202
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,070
So what?!
See if I care!

203
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,310
I won't let it end like this!

204
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,350
Just you watch! I'll come back from this stronger than ever!

205
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,760
She's been like that since we arrived.

206
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,530
It's as if she's regressed to childhood.

207
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,540
Excellency, are you certain that this is a wise idea?

208
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,870
We can still attack after seeing how the peace negotiations at Geneva go.

209
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,880
We must strike while we have the chance!

210
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,290
If we are to gain the upper hand at the negotiation table, there can be no hesitation!

211
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,520
A victory here will give your poll numbers a huge boost, Excellency!

212
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,420
His Excellency, the Viscount Morcerf.

213
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,950
Welcome to our humble home.

214
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,180
What may we do for you today?

215
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,420
Actually, I had hoped to meet with the Count.

216
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,390
The Count's illness has rendered him bedridden.

217
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,330
Yes, I'd heard.

218
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,000
Please, let me wish him a speedy recovery.

219
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,000
I ask that you allow him to remain undisturbed.

220
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,340
At times like this, he will see no one but me.

221
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,040
The Count has complete faith in you, doesn't he?

222
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Please tell him to be on his guard against Monsieur Villefort.

223
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,290
He said that he'll make the Count pay for what he did. So he has to...

224
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,360
You care a great deal for the Count, don't you, Monsieur Albert?

225
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,800
Yes, I suppose...

226
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,830
I am glad that you are concerned for his well-being.

227
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,530
How long have you been with him?

228
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,670
It has been a long time now. A long time since the Count deigned to purchase me.

229
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,580
H-He bought you?!

230
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,150
I was born into the royal family of a certain frontier planet.

231
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,360
Our world is situated between this kingdom and Eastern Space, and had prospered from the trade between them.

232
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,060
However, our good fortune was not to last for long.

233
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,000
War broke out between the Empire and Earth,

234
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,630
...and my homeworld was engulfed in the flames of war.

235
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,710
My father chose to establish an alliance with Earth.

236
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,850
He did this because he had heard that the people of Earth valued freedom highly.

237
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,650
And so, reinforcements arrived from Earth.

238
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,260
My father told me that ten years ago was a time of great turmoil.
He said that he himself had fought in several wars of independence.

239
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,140
Those reinforcements from Earth betrayed my father!

240
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,600
They started a rebellion, leveling false charges against my father,

241
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,610
...claiming that he was working in collusion with the Empire.

242
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,010
My father was killed as a traitor,

243
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,720
...and my mother and I were stripped of our status and sold into the hands of our enemies.

244
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,690
My mother died soon thereafter, and I was left to fend for myself.

245
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,930
I was like a walking corpse.

246
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes, until the day that I met the Count.

247
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dredge up such painful memories.

248
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm a fool, aren't I?

249
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,510
My girlfriend tells me the same thing all the time.

250
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,070
She says I never stop to think about other people's feelings.

251
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,750
Oh, I guess she's more like an old childhood friend than a girlfriend.

252
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,890
She gave a piano recital at the opera house the other day!

253
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,600
"It's a wonderful thing to be able to express yourself that way."

254
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,230
That's what I thought to myself when I heard her performance.

255
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,170
Mademoiselle Haidee, you yourself are good at the harp, right?

256
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,740
Please do my family the honor of paying us a visit sometime.

257
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,580
Allow me to introduce my friends to you.

258
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:51,380
The night we arrived in Paris, the
Count said the following to me:

259
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,560
"Haidee, this is a land where freedom and human rights are appreciated."

260
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,030
"You should do as you wish, acting according to your own free will."

261
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,770
But this is the way that I see it...

262
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,500
If I remain here voluntarily, I am here because I freely choose to do so.

263
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,090
Our young Viscount is one lighthearted kid.

264
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,830
You know? In spite of the fact that there's a fire lit under his old man's ass.

265
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,770
Stop it.

266
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,810
"It's a wonderful thing to be able to express yourself that way."

267
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm gonna puke!
That's so damn pathetic!

268
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,880
You and I are two of a kind.

269
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,980
I can see what you really think, plain as day.

270
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,950
You're wrong.
I don't...

271
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,920
You hate him, don't you?!
You wanna rip him to pieces, don't you?!

272
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,890
Come on, let's have ourselves some fun.

273
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,930
Take your hands off her!

274
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,590
Count...

275
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,630
Leave us.

276
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,400
As you wish.

277
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,090
Monsieur Villefort?

278
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,030
I cast away all of the horrible feelings within myself after I met you.

279
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,690
Or so I believed.

280
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,700
And I thought that if I could only ease your cruel resolve...

281
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,470
But I... I was unable to forget.

282
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,470
I could not forget how I felt when I swore revenge that day.

283
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,880
Considering how I myself feel, it was wrong of me to hope to change how you feel.

284
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,290
Count.

285
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,410
I caused you a great disservice the other day by jumping to conclusions as I did.

286
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,780
As an apology for my impolite behavior, please... Eat this!

287
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,070
Count!

288
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

289
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

290
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

291
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

292
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

293
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

294
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

295
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

296
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

297
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

298
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,580
The person I was in the past is not the person that I am today.

299
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,290
Who we were in the past is not who we are today.

300
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,590
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 14:

301
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,960
Act 14:
Lost Souls

302
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,860
..."Lost Souls".

303
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,430
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
