1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,440
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,330
At long last, the time has come for my friend to bid farewell to things of beauty.

20
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,230
Sincerity, trust, friendship.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,370
All those virtues,

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,910
...all those wonderful things that we possess during childhood,

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,680
...he has now cast into the darkness of space, bidding them adieu.

24
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,010
Act 16:
Scandal

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,390
"Planet Janina invaded by Empire 15 years ago."

26
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,940
"Space Forces hurriedly deployed, commissioned officer makes secret deal with Empire."

27
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,210
Paris has been shaken to its foundation by this scandal involving lead presidential candidate General Morcerf.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,110
Take me to Space Forces Imperial Headquarters.

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,730
I'm Albert de Morcerf.

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,510
That's the son of the general!

31
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,960
Were you and your family aware of what your father had done on Janina?

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,290
Was the General trying to get at the Pasha of Janina's fortune?

33
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,760
Ow! Hey, watch it!
Don't push!

34
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,330
What do you think of your father's shameful acts?

35
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,840
Get out of my way!

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,800
The General should apologize to the people of Paris!

37
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,470
Yeah, he's right!

38
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,470
Issue an apology!

39
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,470
We've heard rumors to the effect that your parents are from Marseilles.

40
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,910
I don't know anything about that!
Didn't I tell you to stand aside?!

41
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,140
There are rumors going around that your family isn't really of nobility.

42
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,340
Is it safe to assume that they falsified their background?

43
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't be rude! I've had about enough of you people insulting my father!

44
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,650
Insulting?! The ones who have been insulted all these years are us! The citizens of Paris!

45
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,920
You're the son of a traitor who colluded with the enemy and sold out the Pasha out of greed!

46
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,660
Viscount Morcerf?!

47
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,660
Where's my father?!
Tell me where my father is!

48
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,230
You came in through the front gate?
What a foolish thing to do...

49
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,140
Come with me to the back entrance.
It's not safe for you here.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,540
My father! Where is he?
Let me speak with him!

51
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:14,320
Unfortunately, he is preoccupied with dealing with everything that has come up, so I believe that he might not return here today.

52
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh, I see.

53
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,050
In that case, give my father this message.
There is something I want to discuss with him.

54
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,990
And also tell my father that I believe in him.

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
Understood.

56
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,750
Enter.

57
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,470
I have done everything that I can. However, explaining things to the National Assembly may prove difficult.

58
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,940
Their discussions are already centering around issuing subpoenas for witnesses.

59
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,890
Understood.
You can go.

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,900
Your son was just here, sir.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
As per your orders, I told him that you were not here.

62
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,230
What did he say?

63
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,140
Your son said that he believes in his father.

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
Albert!
Quick, get in!

65
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,230
Eugenie!

66
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,150
Where do you think you're going at a time like this?

67
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,700
Why can't you do as you're told for once?!

68
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,360
No! Let me go!

69
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,410
Let go of me!

70
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,490
Was I talking to myself when I ordered you people again and again not to let my daughter out of the house?!

71
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,380
Call security!

72
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
Yes, Monsieur!

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
At once!

74
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,490
Something terrible has happened to my friend's family, and you're telling me to look the other way?!

75
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,080
You little fool! If you went out there now, those journalists would eat you alive!

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,300
They'll write about your relationship with Albert, blending fact and fiction until it becomes a farce,

77
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,430
...and we'll be made into toys for the public's amusement!

78
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,060
Can't you see that?!

79
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,930
I don't care about any of that!

80
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,700
Listen, this matter isn't just about you!

81
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,870
I won't tolerate anything that might lower your value, whatever it might be!

82
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,770
Keep a close eye on her to make sure that she doesn't leave the house!

83
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,090
Are you truly that worried about Viscount Morcerf?

84
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,460
If you like, I will go in your place to inquire after Monsieur Albert's well-being.

85
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,960
But I...

86
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,570
You should stay here.

87
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,210
I can't bear the thought of a wonderful person like you being disgraced by heartless people.

88
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,380
I've been looking everywhere for you, Albert.

89
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,950
We're in the middle of a huge scandal, and you walk right into military HQ, the belly of the beast.

90
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,210
That was one stupid stunt, you know that?

91
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,530
"A Word of Advice to General Fernand Morcerf.
By Robert Beauchamp."

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,830
I want you to take me to Beauchamp's place.

93
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,500
Right now!

94
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,740
Hey, sorry I kept you guys waiting.

95
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,910
Albert, what are you...

96
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,380
You bastard! All this time, you were only pretending to be my friend!

97
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,420
"Watch out for scandals", my ass!

98
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,630
You were planning all along to sell out my father to get your big scoop!

99
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,860
Isn't that right?!
Right?!

100
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,840
Listen, Albert, I'm going tell you everything that I uncovered in my investigation.

101
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,640
Just the plain truth.
No lies.

102
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,610
So before you do anything rash, just hear me out.

103
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,140
Take a look at this.

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,000
This is a copy of a title deed that I bought from a black-market merchant in the Empire.

105
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,890
"I cede ownership of Queen Vasiliki of Janina and Princess Haidee..."

106
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,010
"...for the sum of
100 million Francs."

107
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,320
"Seller, Fernand Mondego."

108
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,990
What's this supposed to prove?!

109
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,130
I followed the tracks of this "Mondego" person.

110
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,000
But every last bit of information on him had been erased.

111
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,870
It was almost as if he had never existed.

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,100
But Mondego existed, all right.

113
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,650
When he returned to Marseilles,

114
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,150
...he immediately used the money he had received to purchase orders of nobility.

115
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,010
And that's when he changed his name.

116
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,710
Prove it!
Show me your proof!

117
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,250
Albert, I was also able to learn through Ministry of the Interior records that Mondego was an old friend of Villefort's.

118
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,760
They were both originally from Marseilles.

119
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,500
And then Villefort purged all information regarding Mondego from all public records.

120
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,970
And that's how the man known as Mondego was erased from existence, and the man known as Fernand de Morcerf was born in his place.

121
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,980
What're you two saying?! That my father is the same man as that monster, Mondego?!

122
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,200
Do you two get your kicks by ganging up on somebody and writing about their problems?!

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Come off it! Do you seriously think I decided to have some fun by writing a made-up article?!

124
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,860
Do you have any idea what it did to me to write that article?

125
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,500
Do you really think I'm a slimeball who would sell out his friends for a scoop?!

126
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,130
All right, that's enough.

127
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,430
I'm a journalist.

128
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,030
I have a duty to get the truth out to the people, no matter the cost.

129
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,380
Dammit!

130
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,290
Gankutsuou, the immortal man living in the Chateau d'If...

131
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,690
That mark I saw on the Count's forehead that night in Auteuil...

132
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,560
...was the mark of Gankutsuou, no doubt about it.

133
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,000
Then does that mean that the Count has turned into Gankutsuou?

134
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,300
What's he doing in Paris?

135
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,470
If you keep pushing yourself this hard, you'll ruin your health.

136
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,180
Did you stay up all night again last night?

137
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,580
You sure are a worrywart,
Maximilien.

138
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,180
Please eat. It's just country food, but it will help you keep your strength up.

139
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,460
Hey, that looks great...

140
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,820
Thanks.

141
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,590
Go on, take it to him.

142
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,830
No way!
I'm too embarrassed!

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,430
You were the one who said that you wanted to meet Franz, weren't you?

144
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,660
Then you come in with me, big brother.

145
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,270
And what are you two up to out here?

146
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,600
Big brother!

147
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,630
Um... Uh...

148
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,870
Come on over.

149
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,150
Here! Eat this!

150
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,850
She said you looked like you were in the dumps, so we made these together.

151
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,850
Thanks, you two.

152
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,460
Mark my words!
You'll be next!

153
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,100
Disaster will come calling at your house, too!

154
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,630
This feels strange.

155
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,370
For there to be so many family members in the same house, I mean.

156
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,850
Aren't there a great many people living in your own house, Monsieur Franz?

157
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,040
A long time ago, maybe.
There were lots of servants, too.

158
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,310
But now, there's just a few servants and my mother.

159
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
Oh, I didn't know.

160
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,110
There are a lot of different kinds of aristocrats.

161
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,830
The engagement between Valentine and me was forced on us by Monsieur Villefort...

162
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,920
...just because my family has been known for generations in Paris as staunch royalists.

163
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,330
Unlike Albert's family, mine doesn't have a large fortune,

164
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,100
...so we thought it wouldn't hurt to have some backing once I got into diplomacy.

165
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,140
I'm sorry. I said all those things without knowing the circumstances behind your engagement.

166
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,110
Hey, I'm not so dumb that I need to have you worrying about me.

167
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,310
You'd never guess it by looking at me, but I hit the books pretty hard.

168
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,920
Monsieur Noirtier said it, too.

169
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,040
He said that he wanted you to make
Valentine happy in his place.

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,800
I will!

171
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,640
Who's this man?

172
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,020
My father. He passed away three years ago.

173
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,510
That's a beautiful ship that he owned.

174
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,620
She was called the Pharaon.
She was the star of our fleet.

175
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,990
She's changed hands now, though.

176
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,700
Edmond Dantes?

177
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,760
Oh, Edmond? You know
Edmond Dantes?

178
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,340
You know him?
You know who he is?!

179
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,480
Yes, he worked as first mate for Morrel and Son.

180
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,820
No go, huh?

181
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,330
With that circus out there, I'll never make it through the front door OR the back door.

182
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,830
This way, this way!

183
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,860
Over here.

184
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,860
This is the one gate in the whole mansion that isn't hooked into the security system.

185
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,330
How do you know all this stuff?

186
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,340
Hey, Peppo!

187
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,070
Get a move on. The paparazzi are coming.

188
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,280
I owe you one.

189
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,250
Goodbye, Albert.

190
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,870
Hey, there's somebody over there!

191
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,710
C'mon, let's go!

192
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,960
Mother!
Are you here?!

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,160
Mother!

194
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,300
Mother, aren't you home?

195
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,970
Mother!

196
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,920
Albert...

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,110
Mother! I'm glad you're okay.

198
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,850
Thank goodness you're safe.
Thank goodness...

199
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,760
Mother, l...

200
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,920
Look at how haggard you are.
I bet you haven't eaten.

201
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,130
Wait here. I'll have them fix something for you.

202
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,610
Stop it, Mother. Stop pretending that nothing's wrong.

203
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm sick of people treating me like some clueless kid!

204
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,740
I don't want to hear any more lies.

205
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,020
Fernand and I aren't true aristocrats.

206
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,030
We were commoners born in a small village outside of Marseilles called Catalonia.

207
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,030
Mother...

208
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,060
Then what is Father's real name?

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,030
Your father's real name is Fernand Mondego.

210
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,510
By the time I realized what was happening, it was already too late to turn back.

211
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,050
Once I said that we were aristocrats by birth,
I had no choice but to keep playing the part.

212
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,720
And then the truth finally struck home in the middle of your father's campaign speech.

213
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,220
Why?! Why are you saying these things, too, Mother?!

214
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,230
Why don't you have any faith in Father?!

215
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,630
I heard the speech given by the Janinan princess that day with my own two ears.

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,800
If I had sensed even for an instant that her words were lies,

217
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,470
...I would have passed judgment over her in Heaven's stead right then and there.

218
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,000
But it was true...

219
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,840
Albert... We each must face the consequences of the things we have done.

220
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,710
We must never be allowed to avert our eyes from the truth.

221
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Haidee wanted this to happen from the very beginning!

222
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,170
Damn it!
DAMN IT!

223
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,140
Every year, my father and I would go to place flowers on Edmond Dantes' grave.

224
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,380
Father would always stare out at the sea, and would never tell me much about him.

225
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,190
But as my father lay on his deathbed, he kept calling out his name, tears in his eyes.

226
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,390
"I want to see Edmond!
I want to see Edmond!"

227
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,200
"Why wasn't I able to save Edmond?!"

228
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,500
Maximilien, show me Morrel & Son's crew roster.

229
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,300
I haven't seen many of the records that date back to my father's time.

230
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,970
Edmond... Edmond...

231
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,350
This is him!

232
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,480
It's not him...
His face is completely different.

233
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,880
Still...

234
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,580
What is it about this person?

235
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,550
The name Edmond was in
Monsieur Noirtier's memories.

236
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,020
He said he was sent to a prison in deep space for a crime he didn't commit.

237
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,430
I don't believe it!

238
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,540
Danglars?!
He was the ship's purser?

239
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,050
Now I get it...
So THAT'S what this is all about...

240
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,390
I have to get back there, and fast.
Albert's in danger.

241
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,860
What in the world is the matter?

242
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,430
He's alive!

243
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,000
Edmond Dantes is alive!

244
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,040
Haidee!

245
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,740
Get out here,
Haidee!

246
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,610
Show yourself!
Haidee!

247
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,170
Long time, no see, little boy.

248
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,530
Not since we met back on Luna, right?

249
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,470
Luigi Vampa?

250
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,470
What are you doing in the Count's home?

251
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,870
"What are you doing", he says...

252
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,240
This boy's still as wooly-headed as ever, isn't he?

253
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,710
Go ahead and explain things to him.

254
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,530
But you said that you'd left the bandit gang, Peppo!

255
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,330
I've been keeping an eye on you all this time on the Count's orders, Albert.

256
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,810
I've also been sending detailed reports of your movements to the Count.

257
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,010
Why would the Count do such a thing?

258
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,460
Come on, you must have a vague idea by now.

259
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,690
About why the Count made friends with you on Luna, and then came to Paris.

260
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,290
Shut your mouth!
Where's Haidee?!

261
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,460
Hurry up and send out Haidee!

262
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,200
His servants have left the mansion.

263
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,110
Their master is due to arrive on Earth any time now.

264
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,580
"General Morcerf, the Scandal of Janina"...

265
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,790
You're making your move, aren't you, Count?

266
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,300
Albert, please stay safe.

267
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,990
Haidee!

268
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

269
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

270
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

271
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

272
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

273
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

274
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

275
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

276
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

277
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

278
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,750
Count, you have to tell me.
Where can I find hope?

279
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,830
Where is the truth you spoke of?

280
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,030
Next time on Gankutsuou, the Count of Monte Cristo, act 17:

281
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,620
Act 17:
The Confession

282
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,860
..."The Confession".

283
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,660
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
