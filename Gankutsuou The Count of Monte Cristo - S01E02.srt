1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,520
Ladies and gentlemen\ngood evening.

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,590
My friend said to me "This shall be\nthe prelude to my vengeance."

4
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,000
But this soul was too young\nand beautiful.

5
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,880
It is that alone which\ngives me cause for fear.

6
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,990
{\pos(353350)}Act 2:
Until the Sun Rises Over the Moon

7
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,360
Are you going to come?

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,300
That's enough\nfun and games boy.

9
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,380
I heard you met him\nthe other day.

10
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,630
Are you bored?

11
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
Not at all. It's a wonderful party\ndon't you think?

12
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,200
Where is your friend?

13
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,570
Oh you mean Albert?

14
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,900
He's probably out trying to pick up girls and\ngetting turned down by every one of them.

15
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,980
But this is terrible!
This is Luna!

16
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,410
Strolling around alone at
night is tantamount to suicide!

17
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,780
Surely you're exaggerating...

18
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,920
It's no laughing matter.
You'll get kidnapped by Luigi Vampa!

19
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,130
Luigi Vampa?

20
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,430
He's an up-and-coming\nbandit!

21
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,200
They say that he drags his victims\ninto the catacombs

22
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,960
...tortures them\nand finally kills them!

23
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,430
How horrible!

24
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,870
Surely the police won't\nstand by and do nothing.

25
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,370
You don't know?

26
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,540
The police on Luna arrange\ntheir patrols to avoid the bandits.

27
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,480
My very own cousin was robbed blind\nhad his arms and legs broken

28
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,550
...and was left stark naked\nin the plaza!

29
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,660
All because he spoke\nto the bandit's mistress!

30
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,290
I'm sure he's fine. I bet that he's back\nat your hotel at this very moment.

31
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,000
Would you care\nto dance?

32
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,530
I simply despise when\na party ends.

33
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,200
First one guest leaves then two.
Especially at this hour.

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,710
You won't abandon me\nwill you?

35
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Take him away.

36
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,830
You can't! It's mean!
Today is my birthday!

37
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,030
I'm sorry Franz.
I have to go.

38
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,600
No no no!

39
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,110
Your father is leaving to see to\nsome very important business.

40
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,340
Fine see if I care! I hope\nyou never come back!

41
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,520
Father...

42
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,960
Oh I'm sorry.
Did I keep you waiting long?

43
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,960
I... think I should go.

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,410
Are you Baron
Franz d'Epinay?

45
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,550
Hey you're that...

46
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm sick of\nyour whining!

47
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,660
As for me I killed\nten people!

48
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,690
This is for you.

49
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,490
"My Lord Baron
Franz d'Epinay."

50
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:12,330
"I Luigi Vampa have taken custody of\nyour friend the Viscount Albert Morcerf."

51
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,280
"Hand over the sum of 50 million ducats\nto my messenger immediately."

52
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,440
"If the messenger should\nnot return by sunrise

53
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,140
"...although it pains me to do so\nthink of your friend's life as forfeit."

54
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,320
Where is Albert?!

55
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,320
He's a valuable hostage so we're\ntaking real good care of him.

56
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,120
If the money is handed over he'll be sent\nhome without so much as a scratch.

57
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,420
You should have died!
Is this how you people do things?

58
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,260
Even I have a certain\nlifestyle to maintain.

59
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,960
50 million\nis absurd!

60
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm sure that a Parisian aristocrat won't be\nhard pressed to come up with such a sum.

61
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,540
Dawn comes fast\non Luna.

62
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,010
If you value your\nfriend's life

63
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,640
...I suggest that you make arrangements\nfor the money as soon as possible.

64
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,650
I want to make an immediate withdrawal\nfrom the Bank of Paris!

65
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,250
I'm terribly sorry\nsir

66
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,450
...but our connection to Europe is currently\noffline due to solar winds.

67
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,530
Isn't there anything\nyou can do?!

68
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,530
How much does\nsir require?

69
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,190
Albert... Damn!

70
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,230
Say son it's awfully sad to see a young fella like\nyourself all alone on the last night of Carnival.

71
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,000
If you want I know\na fine girl who...

72
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,040
Please just be quiet\nand drive.

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
It was at my father's funeral\nthat I first met Albert...

74
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,030
Don't cry.

75
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm not crying...

76
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,460
I'll play with you\nso cheer up.

77
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,600
Leave me alone!
Get lost!

78
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,810
Hey...

79
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,790
Ever since that day Albert
and I have been inseparable.

80
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,330
Damn! What am I\ngoing to do?

81
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,420
It's almost sunrise!

82
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,490
Have you raised\nthe money yet?

83
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,500
Give me more time!

84
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,960
Once it's morning I'll have the\nmoney transferred from Paris!

85
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm sorry Luigi is a stickler\nfor punctuality.

86
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,330
If you don't have the money ready by sunrise\nyour friend is a goner.

87
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,780
Stop messing\nwith me!

88
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,810
I suggest that\nyou hurry.

89
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,110
I'm sure that you don't want to see your\nfriend die a horrible death My Lord Baron.

90
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,410
You bastard!

91
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,220
Violence is unseemly
My Lord Baron.

92
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,960
Damn it!

93
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,890
Yeah that's better. A gentleman has
to worry about little things like discretion.

94
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,470
There is no more fascinating spectacle\nthan a man's death.

95
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,380
Yes it almost feels as if one has\nbecome God does it not?

96
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,290
His Excellency\nthe Baron d'Epinay.

97
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,730
I'm sorry to disturb you\nat such an hour...

98
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,840
Is something the matter?
You do not seem entirely well.

99
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,880
Count! I have a favor\nto ask of you!

100
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,160
What's the big idea?!

101
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,830
There is your
50 million ducats.

102
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,860
Now you will take us\nto the hostage.

103
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,310
To the Colosseum!

104
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,760
Have the two of you been\nfriends for a long time?

105
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,400
Yes we've been best friends\nsince we were children.

106
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,890
Ah so you are\nchildhood friends.

107
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,730
Constant friendship...

108
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,040
It is a wonderful thing\nis it not?

109
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Who do you like?
C'mon tell me!

110
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,650
At least give me\na hint!

111
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,650
You wouldn't understand.

112
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,530
Luigi.

113
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,940
It's almost time.

114
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,910
Kill him.

115
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,410
So have you made\nyour peace?

116
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,650
C'mon ma'am\nlet me kill him!

117
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,840
No let me!

118
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,440
Oh give it a rest\nyou two!

119
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,180
You can carve him up as much
as you want after he's dead.

120
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,690
Now then. You should put up\na brave front while you still can.

121
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,900
I wonder what you'll sound like\nwhen you cry?

122
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,100
H-Hey guys.

123
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,680
Um... Visitors to\nsee the boss.

124
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,640
Who are they?

125
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,590
Please Teresa don't!

126
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,820
We can't kill him yet!

127
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,300
B-Because we won't get\nthe money!

128
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,660
And besides... There's still\na little time.

129
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,890
Stand aside!

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,660
If you're going to use that\nuse it on me!

131
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,440
Squabbling among yourselves\nis pathetic!

132
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,040
Thank you.
Stand back.

133
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,180
Are you trying to disgrace\nthe boss?

134
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,680
I'll be fine. Go.

135
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,110
So does that mean\nyou've fallen for that girl?

136
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,190
That's so sweet...

137
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,530
But she's too much for you\nto handle little boy.

138
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,900
Or maybe... you'd rather become\none of us?

139
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,600
You know I think I'll brand you...

140
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,850
Why you...

141
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,150
Leave her alone!

142
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,150
I have come to meet with Signor Luigi Vampa\nwhose reputation is notorious on Luna.

143
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,820
And who are you?

144
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,250
My name is... Gankutsuou.

145
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,430
T-The King\nof the Cave?!

146
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,320
For one such as yourself who\ndwells in the darkness

147
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,260
...I expect that I am better\nknown by that name.

148
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,770
I have your money.
Now hand over the hostage.

149
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,440
I'm sorry but you missed\nthe deadline.

150
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,580
"Always be punctual"\nthat's my motto.

151
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,940
"Punctuality is the politeness\nof kings" is that it?

152
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,050
I'm deeply honored... by your\ngracious words!

153
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,270
I see... Your skill\nis impressive.

154
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,350
But you cannot kill me.

155
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,310
A-Are you...
Are you really...

156
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,410
A-Are you really him?!

157
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,250
I do not work for\nthe authorities.

158
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,070
If you would do me the honor\nof returning my friend

159
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,630
...all will be well.

160
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,380
You aren't injured I take it?

161
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,780
I had a feeling that you\nwould come to rescue me.

162
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,210
If you wish to thank someone
thank the good Baron d'Epinay.

163
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,990
He was gravely concerned\nfor your wellbeing.

164
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,760
Hey! Miss!

165
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,330
Are you okay?

166
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,270
Say I never asked you\nwhat your name was...

167
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,250
I'm Albert.
Albert de Morcerf.

168
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,780
I'm Peppo.

169
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,800
To tell you the truth I was almost considering\nthrowing in my lot with the bandits.

170
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm glad you're all right Albert.

171
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,210
What took you\nso long Franz?

172
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,750
I came this close to being killed\nyou know!

173
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,090
I was seriously...

174
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,770
What was that for?

175
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,600
Please do not concern yourselves\nover the matter.

176
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,040
It served as a pleasant\ndiversion for me.

177
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,140
But I have to do something\nto repay you.

178
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,580
In that case might I ask\none favor of you?

179
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,720
Anything at all!
Just name it!

180
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,960
I should like to take up
residence in Paris at some point.

181
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,030
That's wonderful!

182
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,700
However a rustic aristocrat such as myself\nhas no connections in Paris.

183
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,500
As such might I impose on you to act as\nmy intermediary into Parisian society?

184
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,180
Think nothing of it!

185
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:40,110
In that case I shall call on you on
May 22nd three months from this day

186
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,080
...to commemorate the\nevents of this day.

187
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,960
Where in the world\ndid you find this?

188
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,650
I found it.
At the opera house.

189
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,530
Oh so that is\nwhere it was!

190
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,560
It shames me to say it
but I have looked everywhere for it.

191
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,270
This too shows that there\nis some bond between us.

192
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,100
Please accept it\nwith my gratitude.

193
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,180
Think of it as a small token\nof our friendship.

194
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,340
Really?

195
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,580
It will serve to freeze the memory\nof this day this hour in time.

196
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,510
A memory which belongs\nto us alone.

197
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,890
Thank you so much!
I'll cherish it!

198
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,920
Carnival has ended so what\nare your plans now?

199
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,600
We're going to cut our trip short and\ntake the evening shuttle back to Paris.

200
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,330
Hey wait a minute!
I've already made plans of my own!

201
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,830
You never learn do you?
And what "plans" might these be?

202
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,640
What do you mean?
It's none of your business.

203
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,250
Have you arranged\na rendezvous perhaps?

204
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,810
Sort of...

205
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,260
Love is a\nwonderful thing.

206
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,000
However perhaps you\nhave not noticed yet.

207
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,270
Or perhaps you knew and
arranged the rendezvous regardless.

208
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,470
I do hate to be the bearer\nof bad tidings but...

209
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,840
A boy?

210
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,770
She's a boy?!

211
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,780
Come out and say it! You think
I'm an idiot don't you?!

212
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,940
Not really.

213
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,180
You're always looking down on me\nlaughing at me on the inside!

214
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,580
I'm not laughing\nat you!

215
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,520
If I laughed at every boneheaded stunt\nyou pulled I'd bust a gut!

216
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,330
Anyway you were...

217
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,940
Thanks.

218
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,500
I owe you my life.

219
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,080
I appreciate it.

220
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,760
The fruits of betrayal must
be plucked from the tree...

221
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,890
At long last the appointed day arrives.
He comes to Paris along with a summer storm.

222
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,260
Next time on Gankutsuou
The Count of Monte Cristo act 3

223
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,170
{\pos(352350)}Act 3:
5/22 Stormy

224
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,490
..."5/22 Stormy".

225
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,660
Bide your time\nand hold out hope!
