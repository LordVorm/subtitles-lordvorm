1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,000
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,840
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,680
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,350
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,060
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,900
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,740
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,780
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,910
Love me ever more

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,790
Love me ever more

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,380
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,340
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,100
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,360
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,990
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,660
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,610
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,720
"Death is nothing but a release", my friend once muttered to me.

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,590
"If death is a release, what is it that you wish to give to them?"

21
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,960
My friend answered me succinctly.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,050
"I will give them eternal suffering and remorse."

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,740
Count, I'm done with running away.

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,810
I want to know the truth.

25
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,420
Act 22:
Counterattack

26
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,790
General... Are you certain that we are doing the right thing?

27
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,820
You must be afraid.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,260
There has never been such a thing as "the truth"!

29
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,240
The truth is something that you yourself create based on your own convictions.

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,440
Even if it means setting aside our conscience...

31
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,450
...and turning our weapons on fellow soldiers, sir?

32
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,280
People don't look at their conscience.

33
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,010
What they see is the truth that is standing there before them!

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,460
It was the day before he... The day before Franz died.

35
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,260
That day, I walked all the way here after you confessed your plans to me,

36
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,130
...my world turned upside down.

37
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,670
I can still clearly remember how my tears wouldn't stop flowing...

38
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,540
...as I looked out onto the sun-drenched river.

39
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,220
Franz... Franz gave some parting words to me.

40
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,850
He said to never hate anyone.

41
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,420
He said that feelings of love and feelings of hate...

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,390
...both start out as caring about someone.

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,060
Count, please tell me! Tell me everything!

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,950
Congratulations!

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,770
A toast to Edmond's last night of bachelorhood!

46
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,090
Is Edmond Dantes in there?!

47
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,830
Madame.

48
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,880
We're here on General Morcerf's orders to collect you.

49
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,700
The General will soon be entering Paris.
He will form an interim government,

50
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,980
...and we will see the birth of
President Morcerf before the day is out.

51
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,320
Take me with you. Take me to see him.

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,700
Why, that's... Fernand Mondego!

53
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,620
The National Assembly is hereby under the control of forces loyal to the Eastern Space Fleet!

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,320
Have you lost your mind?!
This is an act of high treason!

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,150
We don't recognize your authority!
We don't!

56
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,630
How dare you?!

57
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,750
Hold your tongues.

58
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,160
You traitor!

59
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,100
The National Assembly is hereby dissolved!

60
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,760
I declare a state of martial law in Paris!

61
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,740
Twenty-five years ago, I was a young man named Edmond Dantes.

62
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,810
Indeed, before that day, I knew nothing of mistrusting others.

63
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,680
I passed the days, praying for the happiness of my father and fiancée.

64
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Edmond Dantes!
You are under arrest...

65
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,190
...as a prime suspect in the assassination of the Prince!

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,290
Edmond?

67
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,850
Edmond!

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,730
Mercedes! This is some sort of misunderstanding!

69
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,870
I'll be fine!

70
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,060
Let go! Edmond!

71
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,600
Edmond!

72
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,340
You've been charged with a crime.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,740
What do you mean?

74
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,510
We received an anonymous tip.

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,140
According to the written accusation, you have in your possession...

76
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,850
...a letter that reveals the plot behind the assassination of the Prince.

77
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,960
What in the world are you talking about?

78
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,130
Before your captain died, I believe he entrusted you with a letter.

79
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,690
Yes, the Captain's last request was that...

80
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,890
...I deliver the letter to the intended recipient.

81
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,140
Paris, Rue Coq-Heron, number 13.
Monsieur Noirtier...

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,480
The letter contained the names of the men involved in the assassination plot.

83
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,820
Villefort's name was also included within.

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,730
And I had unwittingly handed the letter over to the very person I shouldn't have.

85
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,550
I see. You were simply carrying out your duties faithfully.

86
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,170
Dantes. Let me take care of this letter.

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,060
I expect that they'll be releasing you soon.

88
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,430
Thank you so much, Monsieur Villefort!

89
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,710
How can I ever thank you?

90
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,810
My fiancée must be anxiously waiting for me to return.

91
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,440
By the way, have you spoken of this letter to anyone else?

92
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,320
No, Monsieur. I obeyed the Captain's last request and kept it secret.

93
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,690
No one else knows of this letter.

94
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
I see...

95
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,240
Here in Paris, it is believed to this day...

96
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,110
...that the Prince perished in an assassination plot orchestrated by enemies of this world.

97
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,310
But the plot was devised by people from Earth.

98
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,850
Those who had reaped enormous profits from the war wanted it to continue.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,550
But that's...

100
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,160
With the assassination, the worst possible outcome, prospects for peace became a distant memory.

101
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,130
And just as those men wished, the war spread,

102
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,600
...growing ever more intense in the name of avenging the assassination.

103
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,640
A-And one unlucky man was consigned to oblivion.

104
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,590
Those who had exploited me...

105
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,020
...became prominent figures in the financial and legal worlds.

106
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,390
And the man who had climbed to the very top of the military...

107
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,670
...eventually turned his eyes to the presidency.

108
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,370
That is how it happened.

109
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,310
Please! Call Monsieur Villefort!

110
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,640
What crime do they think I committed?!

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,880
I haven't done anything! I'm... I'm innocent!

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,850
What I found waiting for me when I was imprisoned within the Chateau d'If...

113
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,620
...was the very embodiment of endless despair.

114
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,660
It was an automated fortress on the frontier, built to defend against unknown enemies.

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,740
I became a component of its control system.

116
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,310
In that place, that neverending Hell, I was not even allowed the choice of death.

117
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,980
Please, kill me!

118
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,730
Please, kill me right now!

119
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,930
I... I don't care about salvation anymore.

120
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,570
Even if my body should disappear,

121
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,040
...I'll find those who took everything away from me,

122
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,010
...those who drove me to ruin,

123
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,980
...and give them the cruelest, most macabre punishment imaginable!

124
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,890
I won't even give them the respite of death!
What they'll get is eternal suffering!

125
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,760
My friend...

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,680
My friend!

127
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,600
My friend.

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Hope...

129
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,410
Grief...

130
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,780
Longing...

131
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,420
Resignation...

132
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,950
Rage...

133
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,430
Terror...

134
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,200
Despair...

135
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,760
And then, hope once again...

136
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,040
For thousands of years,

137
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,960
...I have waited inside this body for the arrival of a man...

138
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,810
...like you.

139
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,630
I...

140
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm...

141
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,100
I am...

142
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,380
...with you.

143
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,560
And you are...

144
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,690
...with me.

145
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,660
To you, I give my knowledge and power.

146
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,190
And to me,

147
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,400
...you give your body and your spirit!

148
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,620
Albert... I am the Wheel of Fortune.

149
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:43,620
Indeed, it is now only my unyielding, merciless resolve which keeps me moving.

150
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,570
Count! Even after everything that's happened,
I don't want to let you leave!

151
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,760
I want you to give up on your revenge, Count!

152
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,940
Only one man may give an order to the Count of Monte Cristo,

153
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,920
...and that is the Count of Monte Cristo himself.

154
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,990
Count, are you saying that there is no one left in your heart?

155
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,860
Are you saying that the Count of Monte Cristo that I knew no longer exists?

156
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,540
Count!

157
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,980
Father...

158
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,220
Please, stop this... Father!

159
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,090
The Cabinet and National Assembly have ceded full governing authority to the Space Forces.

160
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,730
Martial law has been declared!

161
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Citizens are asked to surrender all weapons and refrain from venturing outdoors!

162
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,080
I repeat, the Cabinet and
National Assembly have ceded...

163
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,300
...full governing authority to the Space Forces.

164
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,950
Martial law has been declared!

165
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,980
My money! My money!

166
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,020
Well, well, what have we here?

167
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,760
So, that's what it's come to?

168
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,570
Is this how the world works?

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,630
Off with your head!
And yours!

170
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,670
Off with your head!
I sentence you to death!

171
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,490
Baptistin!

172
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,650
Stand aside!
I won't let you stop me!

173
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,060
Take this with you.

174
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:06,930
What's this?

175
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,440
If anything happens, give us a shout.
Just don't turn it off.

176
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,840
Don't tell the Count about this, okay?

177
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,910
Underground fortresses! Weapons depots!

178
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,520
There isn't a single one that I don't know about.

179
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,450
I'm going to give them a taste of my power!

180
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,990
Let's get to it!

181
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,290
Your next target is the Arc de Triomphe!

182
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,470
Spineless cowards.

183
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,400
Mercedes! I've been waiting for you!

184
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,940
Look! Paris is finally kneeling before me!

185
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,410
This can't be what you wanted, Fernand.

186
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,120
The dreams that you told me about were full of hope.

187
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,380
But there IS hope! Listen, this pain is necessary for the good of the country!

188
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,680
Fernand...

189
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,990
You're the First Lady now, Mercedes!

190
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,760
There's nothing to be afraid of now!

191
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,930
Edmond is alive, and he's been right under our noses.

192
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,600
He's what?!

193
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,910
The man who was once your best friend...
The man who was once my fiancée...

194
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,620
...has returned to us as the
Count of Monte Cristo.

195
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,420
He survived... But why now?

196
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,690
That letter we received...
So that's what it was all about...

197
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,690
He's come back?

198
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,000
He's come back to get his revenge on us?

199
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,570
Revenge? What are you talking about?

200
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,280
You and Edmond were best friends.
What do you mean, revenge?

201
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,040
Why would Edmond want to get revenge against you?

202
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,660
He and I... were best friends?

203
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,650
I never once thought of that bastard as my friend!

204
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,630
You must have known that!

205
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,900
You're always like this!

206
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,400
Do you have any idea how much that naiveté of yours hurts people?!

207
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,800
That's right. The man who sent that letter that got him arrested was ME!

208
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,500
If I hadn't, he'd have been made the captain of a ship on the interplanetary shipping lanes,

209
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,590
...and I would've spent my entire life as a menial laborer at the Marseilles docks!

210
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,760
I... I had to do it.

211
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,260
Do you understand?! It was you!

212
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,460
Your naiveté cast Edmond into the depths of misery!

213
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,410
I... I can't believe I said such horrible things to you.

214
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,410
I'm sorry... Forgive me!

215
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,850
Mercedes, I love you...

216
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,130
Come with me.

217
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,610
Let's leave Paris together.

218
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,690
I've had it up to here with always being the underdog!

219
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm sick of living in that bastard's shadow!

220
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,970
You're staying here!

221
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,730
You're going to stay here by my side!

222
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,340
I'll never forget the time we've spent together.

223
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,810
Thank you.

224
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,080
Goodbye, Fernand.

225
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,390
Mercedes...

226
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,490
Mercedes!

227
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,660
MERCEDES!

228
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,630
Mother!

229
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,240
Mother! Are you all right?! Mother!

230
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,780
Mother!

231
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,710
Why? Why did this have to happen?!

232
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,960
I loved her.

233
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,090
And I loved you more than anything.

234
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,560
Father...

235
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,260
Not yet... I still have him to deal with.

236
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,360
Albert!

237
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,320
Albert?

238
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,530
Albert!

239
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,070
This isn't over yet!

240
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,540
Eat this!

241
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,160
Albert!

242
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,600
You crazy kid...

243
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,810
Where's Mondego?

244
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,540
This ain't good...

245
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,620
Father...

246
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,260
As long as he's still alive,
I can't die, either!

247
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,110
Monte Cristo!
No, Edmond Dantes!

248
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,950
I'm going to take everything away from you, just as you did to me!

249
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,730
I'm not the man I used to be

250
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:09,450
And what you see is not what it seems

251
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:16,040
I traveled through space to be with you here

252
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,670
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

253
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,890
You won't see me coming...

254
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,400
You won't see me coming...

255
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,400
Till I strike

256
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,290
You won't see me coming...

257
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,800
You won't see me coming...

258
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,930
Till I strike

259
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,540
I continue to plead, as if praying.

260
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,710
To my father. To my mother.
And most of all, to your name.

261
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,920
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 23:

262
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,380
Act 23
Edmond Dantes

263
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,360
..."Edmond Dantes".

264
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,260
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
