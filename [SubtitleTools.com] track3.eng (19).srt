1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,570
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,900
Those who forge their own destiny. Those who balk at their own destiny.

20
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,170
Time visits all men equally and imposes on them a choice for the future.

21
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,010
When the final letter entrusted to the young man is read,

22
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,350
...what future will that bring about for us?

23
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,050
Act 21:
The Golden Boy's True Identity

24
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,960
Count! There's something that
I have to talk to you about!

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,290
Count!

26
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,510
Could he have left Paris already?

27
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,060
As the price of Danglars Bank stocks hits trading limit lows day after day, customers are swarming the teller windows to withdraw their savings.

28
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,720
At this time, the whereabouts of the bank management, including Monsieur Danglars, are unknown.

29
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,420
You bunch of idiots.

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,500
I have your precious treasure right here.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,100
I'll make a profit off of any situation, even bad ones.

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,170
All I need is this stake money, and I'll be good as gold.

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,850
With five trillion francs at my disposal, I can win any speculation war. Now, then, which stock should I start with?

34
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,720
Damn it, I can't stand how inefficient this is without Michelle!

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,520
Good afternoon to you,
Monsieur Danglars.

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,230
Monte Cristo!

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,830
I-I was under the impression that I had bought out all the seats on this special flight.

38
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,470
I have come from Paris.
I was forced to chase you.

39
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,510
Oh, that wasn't necessary.

40
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,600
I had hoped to have you accommodate me with funds.

41
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,380
Five trillion francs.
In cash, right now.

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,210
F-Five trillion?!

43
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,690
According to my contract with you, there is no upper limit to my line of credit.

44
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,770
Surely you haven't forgotten.

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,600
I haven't. Believe me,
I haven't forgotten.

46
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,990
But you've caught me at a bad time.
I'm traveling, so I'm not carrying any...

47
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,000
But surely you are carrying cash in that case, are you not?

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,670
This is...

49
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,770
Come, now. Give it to me.

50
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,970
I couldn't possibly!
This is...

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,340
Now...

52
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,210
Now.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,510
Now!

54
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,880
If you'd turned around and gone home quietly, you wouldn't have had to die.

55
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,390
You fool.

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,390
I'm gonna have to do something about the body...

57
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,830
B-But you're...

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,140
You are as full of avarice as you ever were.

59
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,310
You haven't changed one iota from the old days.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,380
Why aren't you...?

61
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,060
Look closely at my face.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,090
Think back.

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,320
Think back and remember the face of the man that you consigned to oblivion 25 years ago.

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,400
Remember the face of your friend, whom you incriminated with your false accusations against him!

65
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,440
E-Edmond Dantes?!

66
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,880
Edmond... Take good care of this.

67
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,610
You will be the next captain of the ship.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,220
You wanted to see me,
Acting Captain?

70
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,930
Danglars, these figures in the trade ledgers just don't add up.

71
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,970
Oh, um... When we were docked at
Alpha Centauri last month, they...

72
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,510
Listen!
This is embezzlement!

73
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,870
I'll overlook it this one time.
But if I ever see it happen again, I'll...

74
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,320
You think you're
Captain already, huh?

75
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,050
Three cheers for Edmond!

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,460
Mercedes is head over heels for that boy, too!

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Compared to him, all the other guys who hit on her are no better than garbage! Garbage!

78
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,240
So, Edmond and Mercedes are finally having their engagement party next week, huh?

79
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,200
Congratulations!

80
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,700
I'll be praying for those two to live happily ever after!

81
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,310
I'll be...

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Congratulations...

83
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,780
There's no such thing as a perfect man.

84
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,910
Know what I mean, Fernand?

85
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,990
Every man ought to have a flaw or two. Right?

86
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,630
What're you getting at?

87
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,400
When Captain Leclere died, he entrusted
Edmond with a letter.

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,370
What do you suppose was in it?

89
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,620
Word has it that it was a secret document addressed to the dissident faction in Paris.

90
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,030
Well? Pretty interesting, isn't it?

91
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,510
Now, if we were to humbly bring it to the government's attention, what do you suppose would happen to Edmond?

92
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,890
Edmond!

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,350
Edmond!

94
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,520
Mercedes! This is all some kind of mistake!

95
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,250
Don't worry about me!

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,960
Y-You're still alive?

97
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,170
This sure brings back memories...

98
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,810
Of those days aboard the Pharaon, when we all sailed the sea of stars together...

99
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,440
And then...

100
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,620
What are you going to do to me?!

101
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,090
If you think that I was the one who set you up, you've got it all wrong!

102
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,820
I-It was Fernand!
He did it to get your woman!

103
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,600
I only told him about the letter because he was so depressed.

104
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,760
That it would be funny if we reported the letter...

105
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
I only meant it as a joke!

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,720
Out of jealousy and unjustified resentment, you sent an innocent young man to prison.

107
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,420
Is that not the case?

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,350
You're wrong!
It wasn't like that!

109
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,400
You were nothing but an irritation to me!

110
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,530
It made me sick to look at you!

111
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,540
I didn't have any reason! I just wanted to get Edmond Dantes out of my sight!

112
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,680
Those are...!

113
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,650
Amazing!
This is amazing!

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,250
I appreciate your candor.

115
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,860
Now, accept my humble way of repaying you for your bullets.

116
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,860
P-Please, wait!

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,990
Wait, Edmond!

118
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,710
Rejoice. Everything that you touch turns to gold.

119
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,580
Hey, wait a minute!

120
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,840
Take it.

121
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,500
Hey! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here!

122
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,100
Please!
Come back!

123
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,780
And that is one...

124
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,830
Find somewhere else to sleep!

125
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,070
Where's the Count?

126
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,230
You've been waiting for him all this time?
Gee, what a tenacious young man you are.

127
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,970
Don't mock me!
I'm...

128
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,030
"I simply must speak with the Count!"
Is that it?

129
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,510
Lay off! You're just his lackey, so this is none of your business!

130
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,180
Gosh, and here I was about to tell you where the Count is...

131
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,380
Come on, wipe that look off your face.

132
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,760
The Count's in space.
Right about now, I bet Danglars is...

133
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,720
You're kidding!

134
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,460
You can try to put up a fight all you want, but it won't do you any good at this point.

135
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,200
You're the Count's right-hand man, aren't you?!

136
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,960
Why? Why don't you stop him?!

137
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,330
Why can't you understand how the Count really feels?!

138
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,340
Why?!

139
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,180
Don't talk like you know everything!

140
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,870
Why can't YOU understand?

141
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,400
That he has to get revenge in spite of everything.

142
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,290
That he can't forget the past in spite of everything.

143
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,350
He has to do all that in spite of how he feels.

144
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:52,500
Maybe so, but there's something that I have to tell the Count before he loses everything!

145
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,160
They say that Villefort's first trial hearing is gonna be tomorrow.

146
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,530
Now, it's time for little boys to be in bed! Go on home!

147
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,420
Count, this kid might be tougher than you think he is.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,120
This trial in the cases of the poisoning in the Villefort household,

149
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,620
...as well as the attempted murder of the Count of Monte Cristo, will now come to order.

150
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,300
I would like to make a statement before we begin.

151
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,710
My actions were not out of self-interest.

152
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,310
I did what I did in order to protect the peace and public order of Paris.

153
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,640
As such, I plead not guilty with no shame or remorse for my actions,

154
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,340
...and will be acting as my own attorney.

155
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,950
You can't come in if you don't have a permit! Go away!

156
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,890
This poisoning was the result of the attempt by Héloïse, Monsieur Villefort's second wife,

157
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,630
...to poison her stepdaughter Valentine in order to get at her inheritance.

158
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,870
In addition to falsely accusing the Count of Monte Cristo for these murders, Monsieur Villefort also attempted to kill him.

159
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,970
Rather than being motivated by love for his wife, these acts were an attempt by Crown Prosecutor Villefort to protect his...

160
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,970
How dare you?!

161
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,380
Monte Cristo is a disruptive element who is throwing Paris into turmoil!

162
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,420
Another possibility is that he is a spy sent here by the Empire.

163
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,160
As a faithful officer of the court, I call for the immediate arrest of the Count of Monte Cristo!

164
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,930
Is that really the case,
I wonder?

165
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,160
What are you implying?!

166
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,600
I would like to call a witness who can shed some light on the defendant's past.

167
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,150
Order in the courtroom!
Witness, state your name.

168
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,610
My name is Andrea Cavalcanti.

169
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,310
Admittedly, it is an alias.

170
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,820
The witness will answer the question truthfully.

171
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,760
In the orphanage,
I was called Benedetto.

172
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
But I don't know my real name.

173
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,800
I see here that you were known to the public as the head of a notable aristocratic family?

174
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,570
Please, stop that. I'm not an aristocrat.
I'm nothing of the sort.

175
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,410
I was abandoned as an infant, raised in an orphanage,

176
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,050
...and once I got out, I did everything under the sun.

177
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,410
Larceny. Arson.
And even murder.

178
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,490
And what does this have to do with the case at hand?

179
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,850
A great deal. I've come here today to tell the story of the secret behind my birth.

180
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,350
Quit your joking!

181
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,890
Order in the courtroom!
Continue with your testimony.

182
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,870
I was born in Auteuil. In the estate that the
Count of Monte Cristo now uses as his villa.

183
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,930
I was buried alive immediately after I was born.

184
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,670
I was placed in a tiny coffin.

185
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,780
My father must have been in a complete panic.

186
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,480
A judge with a promising future having a child by his lover?

187
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,280
That sort of thing is frowned upon.

188
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,910
So he sheltered my mother in the mansion at Auteuil, and he then took me and...

189
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,090
Your Honor! Perhaps we should adjourn for the day.

190
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,490
The defendant will remain silent!

191
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,960
He's obviously nothing but a blackmailer who was hired by someone!

192
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,410
Who hired you?!

193
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,580
Is this any way to treat me? After all, we haven't seen one another for 17 years.

194
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,210
The people enter into evidence the results of
DNA testing on the defendant and the witness.

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,930
What is this?

196
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,300
The coffin. The coffin that my parents gave to me instead of a crib.

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,530
Please, stop this!

198
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,270
I beg of you! Please, no more!

199
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,000
What wonderful timing. Allow me to introduce my mother.

200
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,480
This is Baroness Victoria Danglars.

201
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,610
Come now, Mother, isn't that true?

202
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,390
Father shoved me into this box and then buried me in the garden behind the mansion, didn't he?

203
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,270
My boy... My darling baby!

204
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,180
Forgive me...
Please, forgive your mother!

205
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,280
Be quiet!
Shut up this instant!

206
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,950
She's out of her mind!

207
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,080
Father! Don't say such things about Mother.

208
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,750
What a terrible thing to say.

209
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,390
It's him! He must be the one who put you up to this!

210
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,560
Your Honor, he made up this entire preposterous story!

211
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,200
How could it be otherwise? I mean, that baby is dead and buried.

212
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,300
He couldn't possibly turn up and...

213
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,480
Your Honor, please enter the defendant's statement just now into the record.

214
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,980
No! I only meant that...

215
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,140
Order!

216
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,910
You have to listen to me! This is a trap!

217
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,210
You lousy con artist!

218
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,360
The servant who saved my life left this scrap of cloth with me.

219
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,690
He must have wrapped me in this so that I wouldn't freeze.

220
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,140
For my whole life, this has been the most important thing in the world to me.

221
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,810
After all, this is the one thing that connects me to you.

222
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,180
You... Are you really?

223
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm sorry, Father.

224
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,760
But if I hadn't resorted to this, you never would have accepted that I really was your son, right?

225
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,060
I wanted to meet you so badly, Father...

226
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,540
Goodbye.

227
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,370
Why, son?

228
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,450
Why?

229
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,880
Oh, you can kiss my ass!

230
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,560
Just looking at those haughty faces of yours makes me want to throw up!

231
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,490
In the end, you bastards are animals no different from him and me!

232
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,490
You hide your filthy true natures behind those clean masks!

233
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,430
You do! And you! And so do you!

234
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,440
I seem to recall a certain Monsieur Dantes living here long ago.

235
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,950
I wouldn't really know. This place has stood empty for a long time.

236
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,430
Edmond...

237
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,800
Mercedes...

238
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,450
You're still young... And something tells me that my boy isn't coming back.

239
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,180
You shouldn't spend your whole life looking after a doddering old man like me.

240
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,050
Please, you should go...

241
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,520
Summer is almost over.

242
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,960
No! I won't!

243
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,360
He'll come back! I know it!

244
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,830
You bastard!

245
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,970
And how are we feeling? Better, I hope?

246
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,780
W-Who are you?
Why are you doing this to me?

247
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh, have you forgotten?

248
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,020
Have you forgotten the innocent man you convicted 25 years ago...

249
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,950
...as the district judge for Marseilles?

250
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,160
The instant you discovered your own name in that letter,

251
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,230
...you decided to secretly eliminate that man.

252
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,910
Edmond Dantes!

253
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,600
Is that really you?!

254
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,370
The man who was once known by that name died in the prison of the Chateau d'If...

255
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,820
...and returned to life as Gankutsuou.

256
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,490
That letter you were carrying was too dangerous!

257
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,090
If I hadn't done something, the government would have fallen into chaos!

258
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,660
I had no choice!

259
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,500
You are indeed a patriot,
Monsieur Villefort!

260
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,500
However, the real motive for your actions was to protect yourself, was it not?

261
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,240
It was to maintain law and order.

262
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,470
And that meritorious deed made you the man you are right now.

263
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,250
It was all for nothing.

264
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,350
By the way, that needle was coated with poison.

265
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,650
What?

266
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
That poison will be a blessing.

267
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:22,220
It will rot your brain and will send you to a world where no one can convict you.

268
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,560
No, wait!

269
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,830
No! Not that!!

270
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,840
Villefort, poor servant of the law...

271
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,340
The wings of the law will gently cradle you until the very end.

272
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,190
And that makes two.

273
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,830
Start walking.

274
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,800
Eastern Fleet flagship has crossed Rubicon Line!

275
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,700
Be advised. According to Article 59 of the
Military Code, this is considered an act of...

276
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,770
I'm not the man I used to be

277
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,490
And what you see is not what it seems

278
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,080
I traveled through space to be with you here

279
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,710
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

280
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,930
You won't see me coming...

281
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,440
You won't see me coming...

282
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,440
Till I strike

283
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,330
You won't see me coming...

284
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,840
You won't see me coming...

285
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Till I strike

286
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,300
In spite of everything, the past will not let go of the men.

287
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,400
Vengeance gives rise to violence, and the cycle of sorrow continues.

288
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,080
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 22:

289
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,500
Act 22:
Counterattack

290
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,500
..."Counterattack".

291
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,080
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
