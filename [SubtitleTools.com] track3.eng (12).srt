1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,070
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,870
There are men who sniff around the mystery that surrounds myself and my friend.

20
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,740
Little by little, their search brings them closer to our secret.

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Hear me, young man and young lady.

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,500
Hear me, noble souls acting in unison.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,060
Be on your guard,

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,920
...and know that there are some things in this world

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,630
...that one is better off not knowing.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,430
Count!

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,480
You miserable brat!

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,750
Die!

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,030
Act 14:
Lost Souls

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,830
You sons of...

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,730
Count! Are you all right?!

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,570
You needn't worry about me.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,170
But...

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,540
Why is this happening to me?!

35
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,380
Hasn't my record always been perfect?!

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,220
You should know that!
Right?

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,550
I've always been above reproach, with no blemish on my record!

38
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,290
Albert!

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,330
This is all your fault! It's all because you brought that accursed Count to Paris!

40
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,330
What lies did you fill his head with?!
Tell me!

41
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,800
Mark my words! Don't get cocky!
You'll be next!

42
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,130
Disaster will come calling at your house, too!

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,570
Give it a rest!

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,610
Hey, let go of me!

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,980
Do you have any idea who I am?!
Let go! Get your hands off me!

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,650
Count!

47
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,790
You should go home now.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,550
Let us meet again some other time.

49
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,490
Are you really okay?

50
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,640
This ain't good...

51
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,870
Hey, Ali!
Do your thing.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
Your abilities are as impressive as ever...

53
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,070
Albert! This is all your fault!

54
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,600
You'll be next! Disaster will come calling at your house, too!

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,140
Yoo-hoo!

56
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,410
You've been in there for ages.
Did something happen?

57
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,610
No, I'm fine.
What is it?

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,510
Maximilien is here to see you.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,420
Maximilien!

60
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,960
Monsieur Albert.

61
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,590
You're looking well!

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,360
It's good to see you again.

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,870
Why the sudden return to Paris?

64
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,370
I've come here to fetch
Monsieur Noirtier.

65
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,280
I thought that he should be at Valentine's side.

66
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,900
I guess you're right.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,750
I came here expecting to have another quarrel with Monsieur Villefort,

68
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,620
...but I heard the news of his arrest the instant I arrived in Paris.

69
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,620
It came as quite a shock to hear what had become of him.

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,660
Yeah...

71
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,920
I wanted to come pay you a visit and express my gratitude.

72
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,960
Thank you for all you have done for us.

73
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,600
Still as upright and formal as ever, huh?

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,200
It was because you were there for me...

75
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,110
...that I was able to save those who are dearest to me.

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,140
If nothing else, please don't forget that one thing.

77
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
Maximilien...

78
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,120
I am glad that
I met you.

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,590
Take good care of Valentine.

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,030
I will.

81
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,730
See you around,
Maximilien.

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,030
Thanks to you, my stocks have hit the trading limit for several days in a row.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,950
These various tidbits of information find their way to me, that's all. I don't really ask for them.

84
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh, how I envy you...

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,620
It's a waste of one's life to tie one's happiness to the fluctuations of numbers.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,650
More importantly, though...

87
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,190
"Dramatic Arrest of Crown Prosecutor
Villefort in Public Spectacle."

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,890
This is most shocking, isn't it?

89
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,900
Yes, it is...

90
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,690
One never can tell what will happen next in life.

91
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,610
By the way, Baron, what's this I hear about you and the Crown Prosecutor being old friends?

92
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,120
Not at all, not at all! We're just acquaintances, we're not what you'd call friends.

93
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,180
Oh, is that true? You, General Morcerf, and the Crown Prosecutor here are old friends,

94
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,650
...and you've used each other's influence to expand your own power bases.

95
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,300
I've heard stories along those lines, so I was curious.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,660
T-That must be a rumor spread by jealous people, no doubt.

97
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,030
Well, if you say so.

98
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,340
Still, people can be brought low by the most unexpected things.

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,640
I suggest that you exercise the utmost caution in the company you choose to keep, Baron.

100
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,650
Baron?

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,580
Yes?

102
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,220
I'm quite serious about your daughter.

103
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,390
I'd like to receive your blessing as soon as possible.

104
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,030
What a mess...

105
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,850
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
My name is Beauchamp.

106
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,810
Y-You're a reporter?

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,390
Yeah.

108
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,420
Then this is your lucky day!

109
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,190
You're gonna have a scoop that's gonna be splashed across the front page!

110
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,790
What do you want in return?

111
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,930
How much will your company pay for a big scoop?

112
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,770
I'm really busy, so if you'll excuse me...

113
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,980
W-Wait! I'm talkin' about a huge scandal involving General Morcerf!

114
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,950
This is gonna knock even YOUR socks off.

115
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,990
Hey, sorry to bother you.

116
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,650
Why did you need to see me so suddenly?

117
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,060
Well, we're doing a special feature on
General Morcerf's presidential bid.

118
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,560
I figured I should use my personal connections, so I was hoping to ask you a few questions.

119
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,630
Sure, if it's something I can answer.

120
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,670
Thanks.

121
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,410
By the way, why do you think your father has managed to achieve such success?

122
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,350
I'd like to hear your frank opinion as one of the people closest to him.

123
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,360
Well, let me think...

124
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
I guess it would be his sincerity.

125
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,270
My father loves and worries about the country in the same way that he loves my mother deeply.

126
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,560
Have you heard about how my father became a hero...

127
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,140
...by defending Janina's citadel to the bitter end?

128
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,540
After he returned to Paris, he used that as a springboard and shot up through the ranks,

129
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,810
...even making it to the rank of general in spite of his young age.

130
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,640
And now he's making a bid for the presidency, huh?

131
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,980
Yes. My father's enthusiasm for politics is the real deal.

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,380
I see...

133
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,390
I'm rooting for your father, too.

134
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,840
It's times like these when a man makes a lot of enemies. You should watch your back, too.

135
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,760
Did something happen?

136
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,860
Nah, it's nothing serious.

137
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,370
But when you deal in gossip like you do in my line of work, you get all kinds of crazy tips.

138
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,780
Tales of bribery, kickbacks, illicit affairs...
You get sick of it.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,110
That's hilarious! My father isn't involved with any of that stuff.

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,120
Frankly, I'm more worried that he might be a little too straight-laced to be a politician.

141
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,550
You don't say...

142
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,460
I'd be relieved if he ever did something like that.

143
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,430
"He's a lot more shrewd than I gave him credit for."

144
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,830
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Sorry to worry you over nothing.

145
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,130
The fact of the matter is, a fishy guy paid me a visit today.

146
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,300
He was this creepy, sleazy old man.
What did he say his name was?

147
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,270
"Caderousse", or something like that.

148
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,910
What did he...

149
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,610
What did that man say about my father?

150
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,140
Oh, some stupid story.

151
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,980
Something about how the stories of your father's exploits at Janina are all a lie.

152
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,560
I told him he was full of crap and chased him away.

153
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,730
Oh...

154
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,200
Open flames are strictly prohibited in this building.

155
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,200
Please extinguish your lighter immediately.

156
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,340
Smoking is prohibited in this room.

157
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,510
Please smoke only in designated areas.

158
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,720
I guess I'd better look into this...

159
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,060
Step right up! Pay our establishment a visit tonight, my good gentlemen!

160
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,300
The dead man has come back to us!

161
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,000
Edmond would never forget what we did, not in a million years.

162
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,340
Something about how the stories of your father's exploits at Janina are all a lie.

163
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,540
Disaster will come calling at your house, too!

164
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,980
No, that's not possible. It couldn't be.

165
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,980
Thank you for agreeing to speak with us.

166
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,890
First of all,
Marquis Cavalcanti,

167
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,390
...there has been an announcement that you are making a huge investment in the Danglars Bank.

168
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,730
What was it that made you decide on that particular bank?

169
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,460
I leave all investment matters to my advisory analysts.

170
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,500
I abide by their decisions and follow their advice. That is the only reason.

171
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,430
There are also rumors that you have been seeing Baron Danglars' daughter.

172
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,710
Oh, are there?

173
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,290
I realize that it is a personal question, but if you would care to make a comment...

174
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,610
All right, just a brief one, then.

175
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,690
The fact is, Eugenie de Danglars and I were formally engaged this morning.

176
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,250
My goodness!
It's like a fairy tale!

177
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,500
Is that true?
Congratulations on your engagement!

178
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,660
This is big news, everyone!

179
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,730
He has to be lying...

180
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,300
Idiot. If I'd known you were here,
I would've been able to play even better.

181
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,240
I would've been playing for you.

182
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,570
Yes. Naturally, she's overjoyed about this, too.

183
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,610
Step right up!

184
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,110
Watch it!

185
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,320
Eugenie...

186
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,250
Please, I have to speak with Eugenie.
Let me see her.

187
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,160
Mademoiselle has said that she doesn't wish to speak with you.

188
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,320
I want to see her in person and ask her how she feels about this.

189
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,380
Please, I'm begging you!

190
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,130
I am sorry, Monsieur.

191
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,140
Please! At least tell her that I'm here!

192
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,010
Eugenie!

193
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,550
Was someone at the door just now?

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,150
No, Mademoiselle.
Just a deliveryman.

195
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,450
Oh.

196
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,230
What are all these flowers for?

197
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,460
What's the meaning of this?!

198
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,960
How could you arrange an engagement for me without asking me about it?!

199
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,930
I told you that your happiness is my main concern, didn't I?

200
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,140
But I'M the one who's going to have to marry him!

201
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,110
You're still young.

202
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,980
It's too soon for you to make important decisions on your own.

203
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,480
Do you really mean what you're saying, Father?

204
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,190
Of course I do.

205
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,490
I wish you'd stop doing this!

206
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,400
Where are you going? I invited
Marquis Cavalcanti to dinner tonight.

207
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,430
Don't be late!

208
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,670
If you're looking for Albert, he's out right now.

209
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,880
Out where?

210
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,970
Beats me.

211
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,400
Oh.

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,420
Albert...

213
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,530
Ow! I didn't throw mine that hard!

214
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,040
You bastard!
Jerk!

215
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,970
Now you're gonna get it!

216
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,450
It's all over between me and Eugenie.

217
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,820
I hear that she got engaged to Cavalcanti.

218
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah...

219
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,890
This isn't what Eugenie wants.
There's something behind it.

220
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,420
Come on, you know Eugenie would never voluntarily get engaged to a guy like that.

221
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,930
I'm not so sure...

222
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,600
I don't know anymore.

223
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,200
I can't tell what's true, and what's a lie.

224
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,110
I just don't know anymore.

225
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,050
Albert...

226
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,810
Franz... I'm still me, aren't I?

227
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,290
Whatever happens,
I'll still be...

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,290
Please, Franz, tell me!
I won't change, right?!

229
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,660
No matter what happens,
I'm still gonna be me, right?!

230
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:34,600
"Death is certain, its hour uncertain", huh?
Talk about a sinister expression...

231
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,380
Albert.

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,110
As far as I'm concerned,
I think I'd rather know the truth.

233
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,410
Even if learning the truth changed who I am.

234
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,190
Franz...

235
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,220
I'm thinking of leaving
Paris for a while.

236
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,960
You're going back to Luna or something?

237
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,330
That's a good idea! At a time like this, a trip is the best thing to...

238
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm sorry, but I can't take you with me.

239
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,000
Why the hell not?!
What's the big idea?!

240
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,140
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,110
You, too, huh?

242
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,850
Now I get it.
We've all grown up.

243
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,010
We're supposed to keep secrets from each other.

244
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,490
You and I should call it quits, too, Franz.

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,800
I mean, a secret hideout?
What are we, kids?

246
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,870
Albert...

247
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,250
Wait for me, Albert.
Trust me, I'll get to the truth.

248
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,490
Albert!

249
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,690
Count?

250
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,130
You weren't hurt!

251
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,540
Yes, I am right as rain.

252
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,470
Is something the matter?
You're out without an umbrella.

253
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,570
Oh, I thought that getting soaked for a change wouldn't be such a bad thing.

254
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,950
So I see.

255
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,910
That reminds me, I'm on my way to go off into space again.

256
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,750
What do you say?
Would you care to join me?

257
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,990
Um... Today isn't a good time.

258
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,590
Oh, I see.

259
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,690
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,330
Oh, there is no need to apologize. I hope that you will accept my offer some other time, then.

261
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,320
I cannot bring myself to leave you here; not with that look on your face.

262
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,190
Come, let us go together.

263
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,530
Welcome home.

264
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,170
We waited for you, but dinner has ended.

265
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,860
I was out looking for Albert.

266
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,740
I see that there is still room in your heart for no one but him.

267
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,210
Monsieur Albert has gone off into deep space.

268
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,150
Apparently, he is going to spend time with the Count at his summer retreat.

269
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,720
Oh... He is?

270
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh, that's right. There's been a steady stream of flowers to congratulate you.

271
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,900
This one is from me.

272
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,480
Why? Why do these things keep happening to me?

273
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,790
Why do you suppose that is?

274
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,030
Count, I'm afraid...

275
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,990
What's the truth?
What is a lie?

276
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,730
That is something that you must decide for yourself.

277
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,130
Do you have the resolve to overcome your limitations and press ever onward?

278
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,210
If you possess a powerful will that bends to no one, I can say this with certainty:

279
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,220
You will be all right.

280
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,990
Count...

281
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,270
The first public speech by presidential race forerunner General Fernand de Morcerf...

282
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
...is about to begin in the
National Assembly building.

283
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,440
Numerous public figures have also rushed here to show their support, and the crowd inside the hall is already at a fever pitch!

284
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,670
General Morcerf, it's time.

285
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,220
Please take your place on the stage, sir.

286
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,520
I only made it this far because
I had you at my side.

287
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,450
I'm so proud of you.

288
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,910
Get the car ready!
I'm going to the National Assembly!

289
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm not the man I used to be

290
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,410
And what you see is not what it seems

291
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

292
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

293
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,850
You won't see me coming...

294
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,360
You won't see me coming...

295
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,360
Till I strike

296
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,250
You won't see me coming...

297
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,760
You won't see me coming...

298
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,890
Till I strike

299
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,120
Away from the worlds of men,
I find myself alone with the Count.

300
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,610
But there is no escaping from the truth.

301
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,920
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 15:

302
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,420
..."The End of Happiness, The Beginning of Truth".

303
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Act 15:
The End of Happiness, The Beginning of Truth

304
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,250
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
