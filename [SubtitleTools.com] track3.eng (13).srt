1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,000
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,840
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,680
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,350
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,060
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,900
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,740
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,780
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,910
Love me ever more

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,790
Love me ever more

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,380
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,340
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,100
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,360
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,990
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,660
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,150
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,890
Anguish. Anxiety.

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,090
Because his soul is so pure and innocent,

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,000
...it is all the more susceptible to becoming troubled and tarnished.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,200
The tarnish becomes an indelible stain, and the stain gradually spreads.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,870
When one is no longer able to trust others,

24
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,220
...is that when one truly becomes an adult?

25
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,060
Act 15:
The End of Happiness, The Beginning of Truth

26
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,170
It's amazing how tiny and insignificant the world we live on is.

27
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,120
Yes. In the vast cosmos, it is but a grain of sand.

28
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,690
And what's more, separated from Earth by a distance of 2:5 light years as we now are,

29
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,690
...the light you are now seeing is that of 25 years ago.

30
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,760
25 years?

31
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,270
Indeed. 25 years.

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm glad that you brought me with you.

33
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,510
Seen from space, all the things that I was agonizing over seem so insignificant.

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,520
Perhaps, but hatred and malice are amplified in the darkness of space.

35
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,540
Everyone's gone away...
Franz has left, and so has Albert.

36
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,410
I'm sorry for asking you to meet me on such short notice, Franz.

37
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,730
That's all right,
I'm glad I had the chance to see you.

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,980
I'm planning on setting out on a trip for a while.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,510
Is Albert going with you?

40
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,860
Apparently, he went off somewhere on a trip of his own.

41
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,960
Even though his father's in the middle of an election campaign.

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,120
Can you believe that guy?

43
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,670
"Somewhere"?
Where do you mean?

44
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,090
I'm sorry,
I don't know, either.

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,830
Oh.

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,100
The one thing I can say for sure...

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,640
...is that he's gotten himself mixed up in something dangerous.

48
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,940
He still hasn't figured that out, though.

49
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,280
Franz, I...

50
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
I know.
You're a victim in all this, too.

51
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,080
Listen, whatever happens, don't forget who you are.

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,230
Look for the truth on your own.

53
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,070
Before I made your acquaintance,

54
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,080
...I traveled to the far reaches of the universe, operating this ship by myself.

55
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,550
You flew a huge ship like this by yourself?!

56
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,820
Yes. At the time, I was quite proud of the fact that I was able to operate it single-handedly.

57
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,900
Come, take a look at that.

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,300
What is that?

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,690
The Milky Way. I am told that in the ancient
Orient, it was called the River of Heaven.

60
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,300
The River of Heaven?

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,310
This is what I wished to show to you.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,310
It's so beautiful...

63
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,250
According to their legends, two lovers lived on the opposite banks...

64
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,980
...separated from one another by the River of Heaven.

65
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,690
They say that once a year, they cross the river and are reunited.

66
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,660
That's a romantic story, don't you think?

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,100
Long ago, I once had a friend, a sailor who was born in Marseilles.

68
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,870
I heard that story many times from him.

69
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,340
I bet that your friend was in love.

70
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,440
This sailor of whom I speak had a beautiful fiancée and a best friend he felt at ease around.

71
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,140
These three were childhood friends, and were always looking out for each other.

72
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,920
Indeed, they were much like you,
Monsieur Franz, and Mademoiselle Eugenie.

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,100
However, the best friend was secretly in love with the sailor's fiancée.

74
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,660
And then, the friend, who would stop at nothing to possess the fiancée,

75
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,780
...framed the sailor for a crime which he did not commit.

76
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,540
Unbeknownst to anyone, the poor sailor spent more than a dozen years...

77
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,340
...chained up in a prison located in the depths of space.

78
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
I can't believe it...

79
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,930
However, a miraculous event occurred,

80
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,530
...and the sailor was set free, whereupon he returned to Marseilles.

81
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,770
I'm relieved to hear that.

82
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,680
However, the beautiful fiancée, rather than waiting for the sailor's return,

83
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,070
...had become engaged to his friend instead.

84
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,680
That's terrible...

85
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,050
I wonder why she didn't wait for the sailor to come home?

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,520
Also, why did the sailor's friend steal away his fiancée in spite of their friendship?

87
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,700
The sailor, now betrayed by both his best friend and his fiancée, never returned to Earth again.

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,300
Why do you cry?

89
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,210
I don't know...

90
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:32,040
Until just recently, I thought that I would never believe in anyone, just as you do.

91
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,740
That's what I told myself...

92
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,150
But for some reason, when I see your face,

93
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,190
...that thought of living that way seems like the saddest thing in the world to me.

94
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,900
Count, let's have faith that our friendship will be the exception to the rule!

95
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,410
At the very least, you're the one person that I can trust!

96
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,920
Is the watch that I gave you still ticking away?

97
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,490
Albert, I shall be departing Paris sometime in the near future.

98
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,930
What do you mean,
Count?

99
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,000
It's so sudden!

100
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,630
Wait, it's not because of your illness, is it?!

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,800
No. There was a certain matter that I had to see to in Paris,

102
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,370
...which is why I have kept my residence on the Champs Elysees.

103
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,780
However, the task I came to accomplish will soon be completed.

104
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:46,490
Morcerf! Morcerf!

105
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,740
Don't say such things!
Please, stay in Paris for good!

106
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,830
Or if that's not possible, please take me with you when you go!

107
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
I don't want to be apart from you!

108
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,310
Do you think that highly of me?

109
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,650
I do!

110
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,290
The ardor of youth eventually cools.

111
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,200
That's not true!
You... To me, you're...

112
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,190
One day...

113
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,070
One day, I will ask you the same question.

114
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,210
I wonder if you will still feel the same way about me then?

115
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,280
Excellency, there's a message from Paris.

116
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,780
If you will pardon me for a moment...

117
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,040
Monsieur Noirtier...
Please, you have to tell me.

118
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,770
Tell me what
Gankutsuou is.

119
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,770
What's this?
Hey, wait a minute!

120
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,420
"In the event of an emergency, it is possible for a third party who knows the password..."

121
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,760
"...to use this pen to make contact with its owner."

122
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,930
Does this mean that if I can figure out the password, I can access your mind directly?

123
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,340
She's so beautiful!

124
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,540
Hey, isn't she...

125
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,620
Right. She's Monte Cristo's...

126
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,390
I realize I am late, but I have come to offer my support to you, General Morcerf.

127
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,190
Well, well!

128
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,730
By all means, please step up to the podium!

129
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:00,250
Valentine... I'm certain that your grandfather told you a very important password.

130
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,250
Do you know what it is?

131
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,860
Valentine, I am now surrounded on all sides by enemies.

132
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,230
If anything should happen to my body, remember this flower.

133
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,730
Blue rose...

134
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,750
My name is Haidee.

135
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,010
Various circumstances brought me to Paris,

136
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,490
...and I have eagerly awaited the day that
I would be able to meet General Morcerf.

137
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,020
Goodness, you honor me.

138
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,330
This may sound rude, but have we met somewhere before, by any chance?

139
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,860
Yes, ten years ago.
I will never forget the day.

140
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,160
When I was four years old, in the land of Janina.

141
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,360
Janina?

142
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,840
You did us the honor of protecting us as a gallant Space Forces officer.

143
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,180
Oh, is that it?

144
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,780
You were a patriot dedicated to defending our country.

145
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,550
Or so I believed, until that day.

146
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,850
Done!

147
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,250
I never expected that I would be using this channel for this purpose...

148
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,890
Still, I have no further need for it now that I have left politics behind.

149
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,520
Thank you, Franz.

150
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,420
You and your friends have kept my granddaughter safe for me.

151
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,680
If there is anything in my memories that might prove useful to you, by all means, take them.

152
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,560
Please take good care of Valentine.

153
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,170
W-Who in the world are you?

154
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,550
I am a sad woman who had the misfortune to lose her father at Janina,

155
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,050
...and to be handed over to slave traders along with her mother.

156
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,030
My father fell victim to the intrigues of a certain young officer, and lost his life as a result.

157
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,360
Oh, my!

158
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,730
What's she talking about?

159
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,370
I-I'm curious as to what this story has to do with these proceedings?

160
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,880
They have no bearing on this? Is that what you are trying to say, General Morcerf?

161
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,770
Or Fernand Mondego, should I say?

162
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,320
What?

163
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,270
What does she mean?

164
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,970
Who IS that woman?

165
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,450
"Mondego"?

166
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,480
Gankutsuou is...

167
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,360
The Chateau d'If.

168
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,120
Edmond Dantes.

169
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,640
My name is
Haidee Tebelin,

170
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,820
...daughter of Ali Tebelin, former Pasha of Janina, and his wife, Vasiliki!

171
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,430
I am the daughter of a father who was brought low by your conspiracy...

172
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,830
...and a mother who lost her life to despair!

173
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,840
Surely you can offer no justification for what you did.

174
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,310
W-What's this nonsense?!

175
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,710
Ladies and gentlemen, it is THIS that is a conspiracy!

176
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,440
A rebellion by malcontents who are trying to disrupt my campaign!

177
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,750
He's right! Grab that woman and get her out of here!

178
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,580
It's a conspiracy!

179
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,480
Don't fall for her lies, everyone!

180
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,050
Now, I think you should leave.

181
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,490
Shut your mouth,
Fernand Mondego!

182
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,300
What's this?
Don't look at me like that!

183
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,500
Are you able to prove what you say?

184
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,880
Why, that's...

185
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,880
Proof that will never fade for as long as I live.
Proof that was branded onto me...

186
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,300
...when I was turned over to the slave traders by that man.

187
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,100
This brand is a record of everything that I have endured.

188
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,330
Haidee... This belonged to your father.
Take it.

189
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,410
If you ever suspect that you are about to be violated, use this to take your own life.

190
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,390
Fernand Mondego. Change your name all you like,

191
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,530
...but the blood of my father that splattered onto your forehead that day...

192
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,920
...will never disappear as long as you shall live!

193
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,450
Ali... I... I know
I'm right.

194
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,380
I did the right thing.

195
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,760
He is my sworn enemy, the man who stole everything from me.

196
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,470
So why do I feel like this?

197
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,240
Ali...

198
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,280
The Count... I must warn him!
I mustn't let the Count suffer as I do now!

199
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,290
Count... Has something happened?

200
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,030
Why do you seem so anxious?

201
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,700
I'm not sure.

202
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,130
I just sense the presence of a deep, terrible darkness.

203
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,940
Count, what should I...

204
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,950
Albert, you should return to Earth.
Without delay.

205
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,450
You should be at your father's side.

206
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,080
My father?

207
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,810
It's times like these when a man makes a lot of enemies. You should watch your back, too.

208
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,560
Has something happened to my father?!

209
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,130
Return home at once. I will lend you my ship, the Spada.

210
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,660
The time has come at last for you to learn everything.

211
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,240
This may be the last time we meet.

212
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,180
No!

213
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,880
Fare thee well,
Albert my friend.

214
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,780
Count...

215
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,400
Why? I thought we were going to trust only each other...

216
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,400
Count!

217
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,130
Count!

218
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,110
Count!

219
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,520
Count!

220
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,020
Count!

221
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,030
Count!

222
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,930
We're going back!

223
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,210
Back to that city where vice flourishes!

224
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,320
Stand by for atmospheric reentry.

225
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm not the man I used to be

226
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:09,410
And what you see is not what it seems

227
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:16,000
I traveled through space to be with you here

228
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,630
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

229
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,850
You won't see me coming...

230
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,360
You won't see me coming...

231
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,360
Till I strike

232
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,250
You won't see me coming...

233
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,760
You won't see me coming...

234
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,890
Till I strike

235
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,060
Everything was a lie.

236
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,560
The tiny rip becomes an enormous tear, and everything I had believed in falls in and is swallowed up by it.

237
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,730
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 16:

238
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,380
Act 16:
Scandal

239
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,660
..."Scandal".

240
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,660
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
