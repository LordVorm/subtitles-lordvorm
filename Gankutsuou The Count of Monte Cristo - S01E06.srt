1
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,950
I was reunited with the young man
at my friend's residence.

2
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,280
His soul, which does not know
what it means to love another,

3
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,910
...was profoundly shaken by one
who does know what it is to love.

4
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,920
He asked, "Do you love
your fiancÃ©e?"

5
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,600
My life is a hollow,
fragile thing.

6
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,870
I think we should give some more
thought to my marriage to Eugenie.

7
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,130
What brought this on?

8
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm just not sure if I really
love her or not.

9
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,920
Pull!

10
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,060
That's what's been
bothering you?

11
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,690
First you go through the motions.
Then the emotions will follow.

12
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,850
Pull!

13
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,780
Monsieur Albert, a messenger from the
Count of Monte Cristo said to deliver this to you.

14
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,320
From the Count?

15
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,910
Invitations to the opera...

16
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,160
"As luck would have it, I managed to secure
an open box at the opera house."

17
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,370
"If you like, would you care
to join me this evening?"

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,420
"By all means, please bring
your fiancÃ©e."

19
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,130
I can't imagine how there could be
any open boxes at the opera house...

20
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,090
You're right.

21
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,340
I'm sorry, but could you
deliver this to Eugenie?

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,010
Albert, you're going
to deliver it.

23
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Father?

24
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,640
Considerate little touches like
this will win her over little by little.

25
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Pull!

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Act 6:
Her Melancholy, My Melancholy

27
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't wake her
this morning.

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,740
Is Monsieur Debray here?

29
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,830
Here comes Mademoiselle!

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,120
Good morning, Mademoiselle.

31
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,460
Good morning.
Is Mother still sleeping?

32
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,250
Yes, Mademoiselle,
it looks that way.

33
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,740
Good morning, Eugenie.
You're as lovely as ever.

34
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,700
Good morning.

35
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,990
You spent the night, I see.

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,880
Father, your soup
is getting cold.

37
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,050
Yes, of course...

38
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,260
Good morning, Baron.

39
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,470
Hello. I trust you
slept well last night?

40
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,890
Yes, sir. Thank you for
your hospitality.

41
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,560
By the way,
about Olympus Trading...

42
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,860
I'm sure of it.

43
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,450
That's a valuable piece of information... Thank you!

44
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,240
I give appropriate compensation to those
who give me information before anyone else.

45
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,790
If you're not in a hurry, would you care
to join us for breakfast?

46
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,340
Thank you for
the invitation.

47
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,760
I was on my way to give
Eugenie her ticket.

48
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,100
I am on my way to visit Baron Danglars
to see to some business negotiations.

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,610
What a lucky coincidence!
Please, allow me to introduce you to them!

50
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,150
This is indeed an unexpected
stroke of good luck.

51
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,990
There are many things at their estate
that you will find interesting.

52
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,580
That reminds me, if you have time, you should
ask them to show you the stables.

53
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,330
Madame Danglars has a horse named Eclipse
that is the finest in all of Paris.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,300
This way, Messieurs. If you will wait
in the parlor for a moment...

55
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
Albert!

56
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,380
Lucien! What brings you here
so early in the morning?

57
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Oh, I had my hands full
with this and that.

58
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,850
Eugenie!
Good morning!

59
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,020
A man has to play
his cards right.

60
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,230
Right?

61
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,110
Count! Do me the honor of allowing me
to invite you to my home next time.

62
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,940
Of course. Gladly.

63
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,990
That reminds me,
I'll stop by your room later!

64
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,500
Michelle, Olympus Trading
has started to fall.

65
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,970
We'll pretend to prop it up,
and then make it fall even farther!

66
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,550
Further buying is inadvisable.
It is below the insolvency line.

67
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,220
I don't care. Wait until it hits bottom,
and then buy them out.

68
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,930
Understood.

69
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,270
A few hundred investors are gonna
hang themselves over this.

70
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,360
Monsieur, the Count of Monte Cristo
is waiting in the parlor.

71
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,110
He is, eh?

72
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,990
Michelle, have the credit
assessment results...

73
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,820
...for this Count of Monte Cristo
person come in yet?

74
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,950
Out of three investigatory agencies,
two rate him as AA+,

75
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,740
...and the third rates him
as AAA.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
His peerage title is valid,
as well.

77
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,330
I bet. He probably paid a lot
of money for it.

78
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm terribly sorry to
keep you waiting.

79
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,300
Oh, you're here,
too, Albert?

80
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,640
Good morning, Baron.
This is the Count of Monte Cristo.

81
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,350
I had hoped to put in
a good word for him.

82
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,390
His Excellency mentioned that
he doesn't have a bank,

83
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,190
...so I thought I should introduce
him to you, Baron.

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,440
That was most considerate
of you.

85
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,900
I'm always glad to meet
fine new customers.

86
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,580
Allow me to introduce Baron Danglars, the
most powerful banker in Paris right now.

87
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,160
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

88
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,750
Look, you missed a spot
over here, too!

89
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,090
You need to be more careful
with Eclipse's grooming.

90
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,630
Yes, Madame.

91
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,470
And never give him anything
but the feed I've specified.

92
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,760
Yes, Madame.

93
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,100
I've received a letter of introduction
and contract papers...

94
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,890
...from the firm of Thomson & French.

95
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,900
To tell you the truth, I'm amazed that they
would act as guarantor for an individual.

96
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,530
They are the largest banking firm
in Eastern Space.

97
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,530
Indeed they are. However, there is one
item in this contract that concerns me.

98
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,830
That concerns you?

99
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,460
According to this, no upper limit
has been set to your line of credit.

100
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,960
In short, it could be interpreted
that my bank...

101
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,550
...would have to indefinitely
continue to provide you...

102
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,670
...with any amount you wished,
no matter how great the sum.

103
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,300
And does that present
a problem?

104
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,220
This is a bit of an
awkward situation.

105
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,730
You say it as if it were nothing, but such
lopsided deals don't exist in this world.

106
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,860
Be that as it may, the firm of Thomson & French
have judged that in my case, they do.

107
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,320
Surely you don't doubt the
validity of this contract?

108
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,450
Not at all, its authenticity has already
been verified. This contract is genuine.

109
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,620
Oh, I see. In which case,
you are saying...

110
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,160
...that it is me that you
are unable to trust.

111
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,770
I got tickets to tonight's
opera from the Count.

112
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,690
About that Count of Monte Cristo fellow...

113
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,860
Apparently, he managed to secure
a box at the opera house.

114
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,820
He's quite a skilled player.

115
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,400
So it would seem.

116
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,700
Why don't we go pay our respects
during intermission tonight?

117
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,120
One, two, three...

118
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,710
Five?

119
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,830
F-Five hundred million?!

120
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,000
I had planned to open an account today
and deposit these.

121
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,050
My intent was to let the interest from
the deposit accrue in the account.

122
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,760
But I see that you
are not interested.

123
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,930
N-Not at all...

124
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,810
You leave me no choice, then.
I shall try another bank.

125
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,400
Please! W-Wait!

126
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,070
Wait...

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,910
Lucien sure is a go-getter, coming over to talk
business with your father so early in the day.

128
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,330
You really are a child,
aren't you?

129
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,370
I can't believe you actually
admire a guy like him.

130
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,710
"A guy like him"?
He's our friend!

131
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,460
I've never thought of him
as a friend.

132
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,090
We've been together
since we were kids!

133
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,180
That "friend" of ours
is sleeping with my mother.

134
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,900
We are agreed, then. I will deposit these
in your account right away.

135
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,820
I shall send over a servant later
to pick up my first loan.

136
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,280
Very well.

137
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,110
Incidentally, it has recently
come to my attention...

138
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,450
...that you own the finest horse
in all of Paris, Baron.

139
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,660
Oh, you have an interest
in horses, Count?

140
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,750
English thoroughbreds
in particular.

141
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,920
The thought had occurred to me
to purchase it from you.

142
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,460
Name your price.

143
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,630
Surely you joke!

144
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,930
That horse belongs to my wife.
I have no intention of selling it.

145
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,560
For the right price,
everything is for sale.

146
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,940
I should think that you would
know that better than anyone, Baron.

147
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,410
This is terrible! Monsieur Danglars
has sold Madame's horse!

148
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,660
He sold Eclipse?

149
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,330
Yes, Mademoiselle!
Just now!

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,540
They're going
to fight again...

151
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,760
Monsieur Danglars said that he was offered
a huge sum. He seemed very excited.

152
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,920
It was the Count...

153
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,010
What is it?
You're interrupting us.

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,770
I'm terribly sorry, Count. This is my wife.

155
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,390
This is the Count of Monte Cristo.

156
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,190
Where is my horse!
Where is my Eclipse?!

157
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,690
I was going to discuss
this with you later.

158
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,990
Count, if you would kindly
excuse us for a moment.

159
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,490
You sold Eclipse?!

160
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,040
Keep your voice down!
Look, don't let this shock you...

161
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,920
That horse was worth 5.8 million Francs,
and the Count bought him for 20 million!

162
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,670
Eclipse was my horse!

163
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,920
Look, that horse
was worth...

164
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,170
This isn't about
the money!

165
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,050
I promised Madame Villefort
that she could use him tomorrow!

166
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,850
You have lots of
other horses!

167
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,010
I refuse to use any horse
but Eclipse!

168
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,850
Get in there and cancel
the deal this instant!

169
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,440
What's this nonsense?

170
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,860
You had no right to sell
my horse!

171
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,740
My good Baroness, if I have upset a beautiful
lady such as yourself, I must apologize.

172
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,990
I had thought that if I offered 60 million,
you would find the amount satisfactory.

173
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,330
But we each have things that are so precious
to us that a price cannot be put upon them.

174
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,250
Please pardon my ineptitude at failing
to take that into consideration.

175
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,260
Oh, my...
That's quite all right.

176
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,970
But just a moment... Did I hear
you say 60 million just now?

177
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Indeed, Madame. I offered
to pay 60 million in gold.

178
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,350
Oh, I see. Please pardon
my silly question.

179
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,440
In that case, I will
take my leave now.

180
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,990
I shall respect Madame's wishes and
do my utmost to remedy the situation.

181
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,990
Count...

182
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,460
Monsieur, were you planning to pocket a
percentage of the profits, even from me?!

183
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,750
You've got it all wrong!

184
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,800
You and your filthy lies!

185
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,090
Come to my
room later!

186
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,970
Come on, Albert,
let's go somewhere.

187
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,680
Shouldn't we
do something?

188
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,300
They're always
like this.

189
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,310
Go faster.

190
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,820
I can't go any faster.

191
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,820
They're the worst...

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,570
The worst family,
and the worst father...

193
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,990
You mean the world
to the Baron.

194
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,620
You don't know him
at all, do you?

195
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,880
If the price was right, he'd sell me off
without giving it a second thought.

196
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,010
As long as we stay here, we'll never be able
to get out from under our parents' thumbs.

197
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,520
I want to live
more freely.

198
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,520
I love the piano. I want to play
all over the world.

199
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,020
Eugenie...

200
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,030
I want to live somewhere far away.
Somewhere that my parents can't reach me.

201
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,910
Then let's go.

202
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,000
You and me.
Let's leave home.

203
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,930
Idiot.

204
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,600
Why am I an idiot?

205
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,850
Let's go back. I have to get
fitted for my dress tonight.

206
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,850
I thought you wanted to leave here! Hey!

207
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,680
Hey, where's Valentine?

208
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,890
What about you?
I thought you were coming with Eugenie.

209
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,980
It's true! He even comes
to me in my dreams!

210
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,030
Do you want to know
what he said to me?

211
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,240
What did he say?

212
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,450
Good evening!

213
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,580
Good evening.

214
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,790
I was given an invitation, too,
but I feel a bit out of place.

215
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,880
Not at all.
It looks wonderful on you.

216
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,380
Um... It's a loaner.

217
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,370
But I thought that the Prince's booth had
been sealed up ever since that incident.

218
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,830
It's been 20 years since that
horrible accident, hasn't it?

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,630
I heard that someone has put it
on permanent reserve.

220
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,340
It's unnerving, isn't it? It's as if the
late Prince has returned.

221
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,840
Come now, let's stop talking
about such frightful things.

222
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,910
What a handsome gentleman...

223
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,210
Who is the young lady
next to him?

224
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,550
I don't know, but she's so lovely,
isn't she?

225
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,890
Albert, who is
your friend?

226
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,890
Madame!

227
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,640
What?! Don't make
such a racket...

228
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,310
Your horse, Madame!
Eclipse has returned!

229
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,940
What did you say?!

230
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,490
A new set of box seats
was unveiled today.

231
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,040
It must be Monte Cristo.

232
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,700
Where are his seats?

233
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,920
That's...
That's the late Prince's box!

234
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,380
What's the meaning
of this?!

235
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,210
I haven't been informed of
any of the details, Monsieur.

236
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,790
How can this be?!

237
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,710
I can't believe it!

238
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,420
His Excellency the Count of Monte Cristo
ordered me to give this to Madame...

239
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,170
...as both an apology and as
a getting-acquainted gift.

240
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,470
Oh, I don't know what to say!
What a wonderful gift!

241
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,310
Deposit of 4.5 trillion dollars from
Vanderbilt Far East of Cygnus Alpha.

242
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,480
Deposit of 328 trillion pesos from the Space Canal
Corporation in the Union of Northern Sanctuaries.

243
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,650
Deposit of
14.2 billion pounds...

244
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,530
...from Gravity Advanced Materials
of the United Central Emirates.

245
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,910
Deposit after deposit
of foreign currency...

246
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,490
...is being made into the Count
of Monte Cristo's account.

247
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,660
Who the hell
is that man?

248
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,660
Where is he making
all this money?

249
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,710
Oh, the Count of Monte Cristo!
What a magnificent man he is!

250
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,300
What a magnificent man!

251
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,340
Michelle, that man is
hiding something.

252
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,350
I detect no
suspicious activity.

253
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,430
Leave no stone unturned. Run thorough
checks on everyone he does business with.

254
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,640
Understood.

255
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,990
That's the man...

256
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,910
That's the man who...

257
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,080
Hoping to help a friend with the
feelings that he secretly harbors,

258
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,250
...I go to visit Valentine.

259
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,550
But what I witness
there is...

260
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,590
Act 7:
The Secret Flower Garden

261
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,010
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, Act 7:

262
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,550
..."The Secret
Flower Garden."

263
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,720
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
