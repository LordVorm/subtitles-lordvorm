1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:08,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,490
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,120
At Luna's Carnival, I encountered an immature soul.

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,580
My friend said to me, "This shall be the prelude to my vengeance."

21
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,900
But this soul was too young and beautiful.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,840
It is that alone which gives me cause for fear.

23
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,970
Act 2:
Until the Sun Rises Over the Moon

24
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,260
Are you going to come?

25
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,200
That's enough fun and games, boy.

26
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,280
I heard you met him the other day.

27
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,530
Are you bored?

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,700
Not at all. It's a wonderful party, don't you think?

29
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,100
Where is your friend?

30
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,470
Oh, you mean Albert?

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,800
He's probably out trying to pick up girls, and getting turned down by every one of them.

32
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,880
But this is terrible!
This is Luna!

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,310
Strolling around alone at
night is tantamount to suicide!

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,680
Surely you're exaggerating...

35
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,820
It's no laughing matter.
You'll get kidnapped by Luigi Vampa!

36
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,030
Luigi Vampa?

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,330
He's an up-and-coming bandit!

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,100
They say that he drags his victims into the catacombs,

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,860
...tortures them, and finally kills them!

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,330
How horrible!

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,770
Surely the police won't stand by and do nothing.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,270
You don't know?

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,440
The police on Luna arrange their patrols to avoid the bandits.

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,380
My very own cousin was robbed blind, had his arms and legs broken,

45
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,450
...and was left stark naked in the plaza!

46
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,560
All because he spoke to the bandit's mistress!

47
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,190
I'm sure he's fine. I bet that he's back at your hotel at this very moment.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,900
Would you care to dance?

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,430
I simply despise when a party ends.

50
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,100
First one guest leaves, then two.
Especially at this hour.

51
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,610
You won't abandon me, will you?

52
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,220
Take him away.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,730
You can't! It's mean!
Today is my birthday!

54
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,930
I'm sorry, Franz.
I have to go.

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,500
No, no, no!

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,010
Your father is leaving to see to some very important business.

57
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,240
Fine, see if I care! I hope you never come back!

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,420
Father...

59
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I keep you waiting long?

60
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,860
I... think I should go.

61
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,310
Are you Baron
Franz d'Epinay?

62
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,450
Hey, you're that...

63
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm sick of your whining!

64
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,560
As for me, I killed ten people!

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,590
This is for you.

66
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,390
"My Lord Baron
Franz d'Epinay."

67
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,230
"I, Luigi Vampa, have taken custody of your friend, the Viscount Albert Morcerf."

68
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,180
"Hand over the sum of 50 million ducats to my messenger immediately."

69
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,340
"If the messenger should not return by sunrise,

70
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,040
"...although it pains me to do so, think of your friend's life as forfeit."

71
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,220
Where is Albert?!

72
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,220
He's a valuable hostage, so we're taking real good care of him.

73
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,020
If the money is handed over, he'll be sent home without so much as a scratch.

74
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,320
You should have died!
Is this how you people do things?

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,160
Even I have a certain lifestyle to maintain.

76
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,860
50 million is absurd!

77
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm sure that a Parisian aristocrat won't be hard pressed to come up with such a sum.

78
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,440
Dawn comes fast on Luna.

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,910
If you value your friend's life,

80
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,540
...I suggest that you make arrangements for the money as soon as possible.

81
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,550
I want to make an immediate withdrawal from the Bank of Paris!

82
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,150
I'm terribly sorry, sir,

83
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,350
...but our connection to Europe is currently offline due to solar winds.

84
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,430
Isn't there anything you can do?!

85
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,430
How much does sir require?

86
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,090
Albert... Damn!

87
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,130
Say, son, it's awfully sad to see a young fella like yourself all alone on the last night of Carnival.

88
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,900
If you want, I know a fine girl who...

89
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,940
Please, just be quiet and drive.

90
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,140
It was at my father's funeral that I first met Albert...

91
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,930
Don't cry.

92
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
I'm not crying...

93
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,360
I'll play with you, so cheer up.

94
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,500
Leave me alone!
Get lost!

95
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,710
Hey...

96
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,690
Ever since that day, Albert
and I have been inseparable.

97
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,230
Damn! What am I going to do?

98
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,320
It's almost sunrise!

99
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,390
Have you raised the money yet?

100
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,400
Give me more time!

101
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,860
Once it's morning, I'll have the money transferred from Paris!

102
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm sorry, Luigi is a stickler for punctuality.

103
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,230
If you don't have the money ready by sunrise, your friend is a goner.

104
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,680
Stop messing with me!

105
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,710
I suggest that you hurry.

106
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm sure that you don't want to see your friend die a horrible death, My Lord Baron.

107
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,310
You bastard!

108
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,120
Violence is unseemly,
My Lord Baron.

109
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,860
Damn it!

110
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,790
Yeah, that's better. A gentleman has
to worry about little things like discretion.

111
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,370
There is no more fascinating spectacle than a man's death.

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Yes, it almost feels as if one has become God, does it not?

113
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,190
His Excellency, the Baron d'Epinay.

114
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,630
I'm sorry to disturb you at such an hour...

115
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,740
Is something the matter?
You do not seem entirely well.

116
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,780
Count! I have a favor to ask of you!

117
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,060
What's the big idea?!

118
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,730
There is your
50 million ducats.

119
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,760
Now, you will take us to the hostage.

120
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,210
To the Colosseum!

121
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,660
Have the two of you been friends for a long time?

122
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,300
Yes, we've been best friends since we were children.

123
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,790
Ah, so you are childhood friends.

124
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,630
Constant friendship...

125
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,940
It is a wonderful thing, is it not?

126
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,580
Who do you like?
C'mon, tell me!

127
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,550
At least give me a hint!

128
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,550
You wouldn't understand.

129
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,430
Luigi.

130
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,840
It's almost time.

131
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,810
Kill him.

132
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,310
So, have you made your peace?

133
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,550
C'mon, ma'am, let me kill him!

134
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,740
No, let me!

135
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,340
Oh, give it a rest, you two!

136
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,080
You can carve him up as much
as you want after he's dead.

137
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,590
Now, then. You should put up a brave front while you still can.

138
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,800
I wonder what you'll sound like when you cry?

139
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,000
H-Hey, guys.

140
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,580
Um... Visitors to see the boss.

141
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,540
Who are they?

142
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,490
Please, Teresa, don't!

143
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,720
We can't kill him yet!

144
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,200
B-Because we won't get the money!

145
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,560
And besides... There's still a little time.

146
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,790
Stand aside!

147
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,560
If you're going to use that, use it on me!

148
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,340
Squabbling among yourselves is pathetic!

149
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,940
Thank you.
Stand back.

150
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,080
Are you trying to disgrace the boss?

151
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,580
I'll be fine. Go.

152
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,010
So, does that mean you've fallen for that girl?

153
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,090
That's so sweet...

154
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,430
But she's too much for you to handle, little boy.

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Or maybe... you'd rather become one of us?

156
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,500
You know, I think I'll brand you...

157
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,750
Why, you...

158
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,050
Leave her alone!

159
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,050
I have come to meet with Signor Luigi Vampa, whose reputation is notorious on Luna.

160
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,720
And who are you?

161
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,150
My name is... Gankutsuou.

162
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,330
T-The King of the Cave?!

163
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,220
For one such as yourself who dwells in the darkness,

164
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,160
...I expect that I am better known by that name.

165
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,670
I have your money.
Now, hand over the hostage.

166
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,340
I'm sorry, but you missed the deadline.

167
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,480
"Always be punctual," that's my motto.

168
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,840
"Punctuality is the politeness of kings," is that it?

169
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,950
I'm deeply honored... by your gracious words!

170
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,170
I see... Your skill is impressive.

171
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,250
But you cannot kill me.

172
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,210
A-Are you...
Are you really...

173
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,310
A-Are you really him?!

174
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,150
I do not work for the authorities.

175
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,970
If you would do me the honor of returning my friend,

176
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,530
...all will be well.

177
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,280
You aren't injured, I take it?

178
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
I had a feeling that you would come to rescue me.

179
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,110
If you wish to thank someone,
thank the good Baron d'Epinay.

180
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,890
He was gravely concerned for your wellbeing.

181
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,660
Hey! Miss!

182
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,230
Are you okay?

183
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,170
Say, I never asked you what your name was...

184
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,150
I'm Albert.
Albert de Morcerf.

185
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm Peppo.

186
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:21,700
To tell you the truth, I was almost considering throwing in my lot with the bandits.

187
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm glad you're all right, Albert.

188
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,110
What took you so long, Franz?

189
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,650
I came this close to being killed, you know!

190
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,990
I was seriously...

191
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,670
What was that for?

192
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,500
Please, do not concern yourselves over the matter.

193
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,940
It served as a pleasant diversion for me.

194
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,040
But I have to do something to repay you.

195
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,480
In that case, might I ask one favor of you?

196
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,620
Anything at all!
Just name it!

197
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,860
I should like to take up
residence in Paris at some point.

198
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,930
That's wonderful!

199
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,600
However, a rustic aristocrat such as myself has no connections in Paris.

200
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,400
As such, might I impose on you to act as my intermediary into Parisian society?

201
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
Think nothing of it!

202
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:40,010
In that case, I shall call on you on
May 22nd, three months from this day,

203
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,980
...to commemorate the events of this day.

204
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,860
Where in the world did you find this?

205
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,550
I found it.
At the opera house.

206
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,430
Oh, so that is where it was!

207
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,460
It shames me to say it,
but I have looked everywhere for it.

208
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,170
This, too, shows that there is some bond between us.

209
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,000
Please accept it with my gratitude.

210
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,080
Think of it as a small token of our friendship.

211
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,240
Really?

212
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,480
It will serve to freeze the memory of this day, this hour, in time.

213
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,410
A memory which belongs to us alone.

214
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,790
Thank you so much!
I'll cherish it!

215
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,820
Carnival has ended, so what are your plans now?

216
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,500
We're going to cut our trip short and take the evening shuttle back to Paris.

217
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,230
Hey, wait a minute!
I've already made plans of my own!

218
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,730
You never learn, do you?
And what "plans" might these be?

219
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,540
What do you mean?
It's none of your business.

220
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,150
Have you arranged a rendezvous, perhaps?

221
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,710
Sort of...

222
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,160
Love is a wonderful thing.

223
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,900
However, perhaps you have not noticed yet.

224
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,170
Or perhaps you knew, and
arranged the rendezvous regardless.

225
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,370
I do hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but...

226
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,740
A boy?

227
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,670
She's a boy?!

228
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,680
Come out and say it! You think
I'm an idiot, don't you?!

229
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,840
Not really.

230
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,080
You're always looking down on me, laughing at me on the inside!

231
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm not laughing at you!

232
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,420
If I laughed at every boneheaded stunt you pulled, I'd bust a gut!

233
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,230
Anyway, you were...

234
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
Thanks.

235
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,400
I owe you my life.

236
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,980
I appreciate it.

237
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,660
The fruits of betrayal must
be plucked from the tree...

238
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm not the man I used to be.

239
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:08,420
And what you see is not what it seems.

240
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,010
I traveled through space to be with you.

241
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:23,640
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear.

242
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,860
You won't see me coming,

243
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,370
you won't see me coming

244
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,370
till I strike!

245
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,260
You won't see me coming,

246
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,770
you won't see me coming

247
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,900
till I strike!

248
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,790
At long last, the appointed day arrives.
He comes to Paris along with a summer storm.

249
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,160
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 3,

250
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Act 3:
5/22, Stormy

251
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,390
..."5/22, Stormy".

252
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,560
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
