1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,990
So tonight I'll sing a song to all my friends

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,830
Also to those we won't be seeing again

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,670
The Count of Monte Cristo

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,340
To those I knew and those I still adore

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,050
And I want to see once more

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,890
I just pray that you will love me and trust me

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,730
Laugh with me and cry with me

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,770
Spend those silent times with me

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,900
Love me ever more

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,780
Love me ever more

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,370
You and I were lovers

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,330
Our dreams were not soured by life

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,090
And then my friends' betrayal

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,350
Meant you never would be my wife

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,270
Harsh words were said

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,980
And lies were told instead

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,650
I didn't ever mean to make you cry

18
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,090
Get your moccoletti!
How 'bout a moccoletto!

19
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,870
Act 1:
At Journey's End, We Meet

20
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,410
Franz!

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,620
Franz!

22
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,850
Why, hello, Marquise!

23
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,260
When did you arrive on Luna?

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,300
I made a loop around the inner planets.
I arrived only yesterday.

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,160
I see. You arrived just in time
to catch the end of Carnival.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,570
And by the way...
Who is this?

27
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,800
Ma'am!

28
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,170
My traveling companion, as well as my best friend.

29
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,470
Viscount Albert de Morcerf.

30
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,840
I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Madame.

31
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,840
My... You're the son of General Morcerf.

32
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,920
Well, well...

33
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,850
Is this your first time on Luna?
I suggest you enjoy yourself, then.

34
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,630
This is a city where all your desires can be fulfilled, no matter what they may be.

35
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,570
Apparently, he styles himself a count.

36
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,240
But I'm not so sure.

37
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,780
Regardless, Luna's high society has been abuzz with rumors about him this past month.

38
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,070
There are some who say that he's a nouveau riche who made his fortune on the frontier, or that he's an alien from outer space,

39
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,620
...or even that he's a monster
in human form, or a vampire.

40
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,490
That might be going a little far...

41
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,700
Excuse me, but what is he called?

42
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,930
What is his name?

43
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,400
The Count of Monte Cristo.

44
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,130
"Death is certain, its hour uncertain."

45
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,340
Are you sure you weren't dreaming or something? Daydreaming or whatever?

46
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,170
Get serious. This proves that it was real.

47
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,450
And?

48
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,970
I'm gonna use it to make his acquaintance.
To meet the Count.

49
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,980
Are you crazy?
It's a huge hassle.

50
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,150
Don't do it. You have no idea
who this guy really is.

51
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,610
You think so?

52
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,440
Sure I do!

53
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,100
Begging monsieur's pardon, but are you
Viscount Morcerf from room 405?

54
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,560
Y-Yes.
Yes, that's me.

55
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,200
I have a message from my master,
the Count of Monte Cristo.

56
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,110
Well? What do you think?

57
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,680
What do I think of what?

58
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,690
Why would he want to talk to two complete strangers like us?

59
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,820
His note said that he wanted to establish friendly relations with fellow aristocrats who were staying in the same hotel, didn't it?

60
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,390
What a coincidence...

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,930
I'm not so sure.

62
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,460
There you go again.
You're such a worrywart.

63
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,230
At least stay and have dinner with the man.

64
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,600
I have some doubts about whether this guy is even a real aristocrat.

65
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,870
This is Luna, remember?
He's almost certainly a con-

66
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,090
How do you do, messieurs. I am called the Count of Monte Cristo.

67
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,420
Thank you for coming.

68
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
Come now, this won't do.

69
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,200
When a man has come all the way to Luna, he simply must try these dishes.

70
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,970
Are you sure? We're the only ones who are eating.

71
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,280
You haven't touched anything all through dinner.

72
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,330
Please, you needn't concern yourselves about me.

73
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Just as journeys traveled alone are dull, daily meals eaten alone have no flavor.

74
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,420
For me, speaking with guests as I am now is the greatest feast I could wish for.

75
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,860
Please, help yourselves.

76
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,390
Incidentally, what did you think of the opera today?

77
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,100
Speaking for myself, I don't
normally see operas very often,

78
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,870
...but I couldn't help being drawn into the story!

79
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,340
Oh, I see.

80
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,010
So, Monsieur Albert, are you saying that you have someone...

81
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,910
...whom you pine away for, just as in the play?

82
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,110
No, of course not!

83
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,750
Come on, 'fess up.

84
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,780
Eugenie and I were chosen for each other by our parents.

85
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,560
I've never been in love like the main character of that opera.

86
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,970
It's the same with everything else in my life.

87
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,900
Something that I can lose myself in.

88
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,510
Something that will grab my heart and never let go.

89
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,840
I set out on this journey to find that something.

90
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,980
Why are you trying to make it sound so noble?

91
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,900
As I recall, the goal of this little quest had more to do with what's below your waist.

92
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,410
Franz! Cut it out!

93
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,990
Oh, youth is a wonderful thing.

94
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,520
Endless possibilities. Hopes.
And ardent passion.

95
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,530
Count, have you ever been in love like that?

96
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,130
I have.

97
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,640
What sort of woman was she?

98
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,180
Hey! Don't be rude!

99
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,510
To be honest, I, too, once had
feelings for a certain woman.

100
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,920
As well as dreams of a future with this woman.

101
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,380
However...

102
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,750
...all of them ended as nothing more than dreams.

103
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,370
In short, those dreams were only dreams.

104
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,770
And in those dreams' stead stands the man that I have become.

105
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,150
Bertuccio!
Coffee for our guests.

106
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,270
At once.

107
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,780
I thank you for the honor of your company tonight.

108
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,890
Not at all, sir!
The honor was ours!

109
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,330
I would like you to join me for luncheon on my balcony tomorrow. What say you?

110
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,460
Really?
We'd be honored to...

111
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,530
We're terribly sorry, Count.

112
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,490
We appreciate your kind offer, but we couldn't possibly accept.

113
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,530
Luna's public executions
are the highlight of Carnival.

114
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,040
The festivities reach their peak as the blood of heinous criminals...

115
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,150
...washes away the crowd's sins.

116
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,040
One cannot speak of experiencing Luna's
Carnival without having seen this spectacle.

117
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,220
Is that not so,
Monsieur Albert?

118
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,950
Y-Yes, sir.
You're exactly right, Count!

119
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,230
In that case, I shall await you here in this room again tomorrow.

120
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,470
Pleasant dreams to both of you.

121
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,710
Hey! Albert!

122
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,940
Yeah?

123
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,010
What's the matter?
You don't look so good.

124
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,160
It was cold.
His hand was as cold as ice...

125
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,490
It was like a corpse's hand...

126
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,360
Who are today's condemned?

127
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,160
One is a man who committed murder out of poverty.

128
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,640
One is a man who committed murder over a love affair.

129
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:34,040
And the third is a man who slaughtered an entire family to steal their possessions.

130
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,880
All three are heinous criminals who are beyond forgiveness.

131
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,850
I did it to feed my family!
I had to!

132
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,460
My beloved wife and child, please forgive me!

133
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,530
Please, spare me...

134
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,600
Stop that!
Stop it at once!

135
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,310
My Lord Cardinal!
I didn't murder anyone!

136
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,380
My rival framed me!
I'm innocent!

137
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,540
Please, undo these chains!

138
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,510
You have to believe me!

139
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,110
I bet they're just saying anything that might earn them a reprieve.

140
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,520
I didn't do it!
I didn't do anything!

141
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,060
You moron!
Shut your trap!

142
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,630
I'm sick of you and your damn whining!

143
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,430
As for me, I killed ten people!

144
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,870
Women and children,
I killed 'em all!

145
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,340
How's that?! Live it up, you bastards!

146
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,280
C'mon! I wanna see some more happy faces out there!

147
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,590
Today's card is most entertaining.

148
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,660
What say you?

149
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,330
Why don't we have a bit of sport with this?

150
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,840
A sideshow to the execution, as it were.

151
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,170
I have here a single letter.

152
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,670
It is a letter of pardon that
was given to me by the Cardinal.

153
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,110
How in the world did you get something like that?

154
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,080
Unfortunately, I have but this one letter of pardon.

155
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,590
To make the choice an impartial one,

156
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,990
...I have written the initials of one of the condemned men on each card.

157
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
Now, please choose one of them.

158
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,590
Come now, it's nothing more than a little game.

159
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,100
Just a minute, Count!

160
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,610
If that's the case, shouldn't we hear what they have to say first?!

161
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,610
My good Monsieur Franz, we are not judges.

162
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,380
Regardless of what we do, they are going to die.

163
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,820
I merely suggest that we make use of that fact in order to enjoy ourselves.

164
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,390
At this moment, we have in our hands the power to offer the hand of salvation to them.

165
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,700
Why do you hesitate to make
use of that power to do good?

166
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,770
Yes, it almost feels as if one
has become God, does it not?

167
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,570
What are you thinking?!

168
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,380
You're using people's lives as a game?! You're crazy!

169
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,740
Come on, let's go.
Albert!

170
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,980
A game?
Yes, it is a game.

171
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,980
Our own lives are pieces that are toyed with as part of someone else's game.

172
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,400
Has it ever seemed that way to you?

173
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,770
I wouldn't know.

174
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,670
Let's go!
Come on!

175
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,500
I was of the opinion that you and
I would be friends, Monsieur Albert.

176
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,440
This is most disappointing.

177
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,150
You set out on your journey in order to find something.

178
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,660
To find and grab hold of a new you.
Through the exertion of your own will.

179
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,820
Come on, Albert, let's go!

180
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,920
Albert!

181
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,500
I'll... I'll do it!

182
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,100
Don't do it!
You'll be sorry you did!

183
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,410
It's just a game.
Isn't it, Count?

184
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,480
No! No!

185
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,190
Albert...

186
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,520
No!

187
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,270
Albert!

188
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,550
A pardon has been issued by the Cardinal!

189
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,060
The condemned man who is to be pardoned is...

190
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,760
...Rocca Briori,
also known as Peppino!

191
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,130
How do ya like that?!

192
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,100
Thank you!
Thanks oh so much!

193
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,180
Long live His Excellency the Cardinal!

194
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,590
Monsieur Albert, you have done a good deed.

195
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,490
Truly a good deed.

196
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,490
Now, the show is beginning.

197
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,290
Kill him! Kill him!

198
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,700
Kill him! Kill him!

199
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,130
You mustn't look away,
Monsieur Albert.

200
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,900
Not for an instant.

201
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,700
Kill! Kill! Kill!

202
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,810
Don't hold back,
Baptistin.

203
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,070
Please forgive me.

204
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,350
My vengeance...

205
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,110
...is now set in motion.

206
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,310
Hey, let's go to a cafe or something to clear our heads.

207
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,620
Or how about hitting the red-light district?

208
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,690
Oh, right. I forgot. Sorry about that.
You hate that sort of thing, don't you?

209
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,030
I guess there's always the casino...

210
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,290
Please, don't talk to me about gambling!

211
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,390
What's gotten into you?

212
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,940
You were the one who was dying to see it in the first place.

213
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,280
And then you let the Count talk you into...

214
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,350
I know that!

215
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,710
I know that!
I know all that!

216
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,720
"I brought this on my own head, and that's why I'm angry! I'm angry at myself!" Right?

217
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,160
You're always fussing over me!

218
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,260
Are you my girlfriend?
Are you my mother?!

219
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,590
Are you?

220
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,900
I'm going back to the hotel to get ready for the ball.

221
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,510
What about you?

222
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,100
You alone?

223
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,930
Tonight is the last night of Carnival.
You shouldn't be alone on a night like this.

224
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,410
I want to be alone.
Today was the worst day of my life.

225
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,800
Albert...

226
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,090
Hey, don't be in such a rush...

227
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,100
Are you going to come?

228
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,700
I'm not the man I used to be

229
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:09,420
And what you see is not what it seems

230
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:16,010
I traveled through space to be with you here

231
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,640
What you don't know, you shouldn't fear

232
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,860
You won't see me coming...

233
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,370
You won't see me coming...

234
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,370
Till I strike

235
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,260
You won't see me coming...

236
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,770
You won't see me coming...

237
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,900
Till I strike

238
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,650
A passing fling on Luna.
It was a trap set by bandits.

239
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,280
Moment by moment, the hour of death approaches.

240
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,460
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 2:

241
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,490
Next time on Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo, act 2:

242
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Act 2:
Until the Sun Rises Over the Moon

243
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,460
..."Until the Sun
Rises Over the Moon".

244
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,390
..."Until the Sun
Rises Over the Moon".

245
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,720
Bide your time, and hold out hope!
